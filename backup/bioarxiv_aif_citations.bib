	abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) and splicing are known to be important regulatory processes for controlling protein function and activity. However, there have been limitations in analyzing the interplay of alternative splicing and PTMs, which stems from the deep differences in genomic and proteomic databases. In this work, we bridged the protein- and genome-centric world views to map PTMs to genomic locations for subsequent projection of PTMs onto alternative isoforms. We then performed a systematic analysis of the diversification of PTMs by alternative splicing, including exploration of the modification-specific rates of inclusion across isoforms and how often the regulatory sequences directly flanking a PTM are impacted by splicing, which might indicate altered regulatory or binding interactions in the alternatively spliced isoform. We found that 6-51\% of PTMs are excluded from at least one isoform, depending on the modification type. Further, approximately 2\% of prospective PTM sites exhibited altered regulatory sequences surrounding the modification site, suggesting that regulatory or binding interactions might be diversified in these proteoforms. Lastly, we applied this PTM-to-isoform mapping approach to explore the impacts of disease-related splicing in prostate cancer, identifying possible new hypotheses explaining the variable consequences of ESRP1 expression in different cancers. As a part of this work, we have provided an easily implementable tool for annotating splice events identified from RNA-sequencing with PTMs and their functional consequences, called PTM-POSE.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Anatomical studies have revealed a prominent role for feedback projections in the primate visual cortex. Theoretical models suggest that these projections support important brain functions, like attention, prediction, and learning. However, these models make different predictions about the relationship between feedback connectivity and neuronal stimulus selectivity. We have therefore performed simultaneous recordings in different regions of the primate dorsal visual pathway. Specifically, we recorded neural activity from the medial superior temporal (MST) area, and one of its main feedback targets, the middle temporal (MT) area. We estimated functional connectivity from correlations in the single-neuron spike trains and performed electrical microstimulation in MST to determine its causal influence on MT. Both methods revealed that inhibitory feedback occurred more commonly when the source and target neurons had very different stimulus preferences. At the same time, the strength of feedback suppression was greater for neurons with similar preferences. Excitatory feedback projections, in contrast, showed no consistent relationship with stimulus preferences. These results suggest that corticocortical feedback could play a role in shaping sensory responses according to behavioral or environmental context.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Cue reactivity is the maladaptive neurobiological and behavioral response upon exposure to drug cues and is a major driver of relapse. The leading hypothesis is that dopamine release by addictive drugs represents a persistently positive reward prediction error that causes runaway enhancement of dopamine responses to drug cues, leading to their pathological overvaluation compared to non-drug reward alternatives. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Here we developed Pavlovian and operant procedures to measure firing responses, within the same dopamine neurons, to drug versus natural reward cues, which we found to be similarly enhanced compared to cues predicting natural rewards in drug-na{\"\i}ve controls. This enhancement was associated with increased behavioral reactivity to the drug cue, suggesting that dopamine release is still critical to cue reactivity, albeit not as previously hypothesized. These results challenge the prevailing hypothesis of cue reactivity, warranting new models of dopaminergic function in drug addiction, and provide critical insights into the neurobiology of cue reactivity with potential implications for relapse prevention.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Although affective state may occur almost inevitably together with physiological changes, it is still unclear whether events evoking similar affective experiences also produce comparable physiological responses or whether variation is the norm within individuals. To unravel this debate, we investigated the correspondence between physiological reactions and experienced arousal and valence, using representational similarity analysis. In two independent (Ns = 491 and 64) samples and three affect-inducing tasks, representational similarity matrices (RSMs) of skin conductance (SCR) and startle responses, as readouts of arousal and valence, respectively, were compared to RSMs of valence and arousal ratings that align with these competing theories. Furthermore, to address the role of intraindividual variability, we also investigated its influence on the relationship between physiological responses and experienced affect. We observed that dismissing vs considering intraindividual variability led to differential relations with models of valence and arousal, but models assuming variation proofed to be more representative of individual physiological patterns. Importantly, we observed strong to decisive evidence for a correspondence between SCR and startle responses and models of arousal and valence that assume variation, especially between trials evoking higher amplitude responses. These results emphasize the importance of considering intraindividual variability to assess the affect-physiology relationship (and in psychophysiology research in general) and invite to reconsider the notion of physiological reactivity as a potential indicator of affective states, prompting a shift towards understanding the mechanisms through which physiological changes contribute to conscious affective experiences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This decide-then-act perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions {\textendash} called embodied decisions {\textendash} that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with the choice alternatives and required to {\textquotedblleft}change mind{\textquotedblright} between them, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference {\textendash} a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings {\textendash} namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of losing valid opportunities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The signals registered by our senses are inherently ambiguous. Subjective experience, by contrast, is informative: it portrays one interpretation of the sensory environment at a time while discarding competing alternatives. This is exemplified by bistable perception, where ambiguous sensory information induces prolonged intervals of alternating unambiguous perceptual states. According to predictive-processing accounts of bistable perception, perceptual experiences in the recent past constitute a predictive context that stabilizes perception, while sensory information that is in conflict with this predictive context evokes prediction errors. These prediction errors are thought to drive spontaneous perceptual switches. We asked whether this mechanism generalizes to conflicts between other forms of predictive context and sensory information.To this aim, we investigated the neural correlates of perceptual conflicts with temporal and spatial context during bistable perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-six healthy participants viewed serial presentations of ambiguous structure-from-motion stimuli either in isolation (conflict with temporal context) or embedded in a similar but unambiguous surround stimulus (conflict with spatial context). The neural correlates of conflicts with temporal and spatial context overlapped in the anterior insula bilaterally. Model-based analyses similarly yielded common prediction error signals in the anterior insula bilaterally, right inferior frontal gyrus and right inferior parietal lobe. Together, these findings point to a generic role of these frontoparietal regions in detecting perceptual conflict and thus in the construction of unambiguous perceptual experiences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Recent computational models propose that the probability of selecting a specific action is also, in part, based on how often this action was selected before, independent of previous outcomes or reward. However, these new models so far lack empirical support. Here, we present evidence of a repetition bias using a novel sequential decision-making task and computational modeling to reveal the influence of choice frequency on human value-based choices. Specifically, we find that value-based decisions can be best explained by concurrent influence of both goal-directed reward seeking and a repetition bias. We also show that participants differ substantially in their repetition bias strength, and relate these measures to task performance. The new task enables a novel way to measure the influence of choice repetition on decision-making. These findings can serve as a basis for further experimental studies on the interplay between rewards and choice history in human decision-making.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Participants controlled visual objects via a computer mouse, with tasks designed to test their ability to judge control or detect controlled objects under varying noise conditions. Our findings reveal that participants formed high-level, low-dimensional action plans that were idiosyncratic across but consistent within individuals to infer their degree of control. Employing transformer-LSTM-based autoencoders, we captured these action plans and demonstrated that the geometrical and dynamical properties of these action plans could predict behavioural profiles in the tasks with remarkable accuracy. This suggests that participants{\textquoteright} sense of control is shaped by actively altering action plans, viewed as generating causal evidence through intervention. Further, participants proactively expanded the diversity of their action plans, facilitating the exploration of available action plan options while accumulating causal evidence for the inference process. Contrarily, patients with schizophrenia exhibited reduced action plan diversity, suggesting impaired active control inference and detection of self-relevant cues. These findings offer a more comprehensive understanding of the sense of agency, deeply rooted in the process of active causal inference.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.ℝReal numberℕNatural numberMMotor sequenceM̂Reconstructed motor sequenceMMotor sequence spacemVelocity vectorPMotion trajectorypt - Mouse position at time taAction planAAction plan sequenceȧAction plan dynamicsȦAction plan dynamics sequenceAAction plan spaceaiThe activation of the ith neuron of the action plan a},

The arousal representation generalized to two additional movie-watching datasets. Predictions based on multivariate patterns of activation underperformed connectome-based predictions and did not generalize.

	abstract = {A prominent concept in the domain of motor control is that of forward models in the brain, which predict the sensory consequences of one{\textquoteright}s actions for improved state estimation and on-line control. This idea can be extended to action planning; i.e., assuming that sensory forward predictions are also issued during the preparation of movements, in the absence of overt movement or related sensory feedback. To test this idea, we combined a delayed movement task with a virtual reality based manipulation of visuomotor congruence during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants (18 female, 22 male) executed hand movements after a delay. During the delay, two aspects of the upcoming movement could be pre-cued: the movement type (opening or closing) and the visuomotor mapping (i.e., of executed hand movements and virtual hand movement feedback). Frontoparietal areas showed increased delay period activity when a specific movement was cued (vs uncued) and when an incongruent (inverted vs congruent) visuomotor mapping was cued. The cerebellum showed increased responses during the preparation for incongruent mappings independently of planning (i.e., cued and uncued movements). The left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) showed an interaction effect; i.e., a relatively stronger activity increase when a specific movement was prepared under expected visuomotor incongruence. These results suggest that motor planning entails a forward prediction of visual body movement consequences, likely implemented by the cerebellum; which can be adjusted in anticipation of novel visuomotor mappings, and integrated with state estimates for (planned) control in frontoparietal areas, most notably, in the aIPS.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Segregation of complex sounds such as speech, animal vocalizations, and music simultaneously emanating from multiple sources, referred to as the {\textquotedblleft}cocktail party problem{\textquotedblright} is a remarkable ability that is common in humans and animals alike. The neural underpinnings of this process have been extensively studied behaviorally and physiologically in non-human animals primarily with simplified sounds (tones and noise sequences). In humans, segregation experiments utilizing more complex speech mixtures are common; but physiological experiments have relied on EEG/MEG/ECoG recordings that sample activity from many thousands of neurons, often obscuring the detailed processes that give rise to the observed segregation. The present study combines the insights attainable from animal single-unit physiology with segregation of speech-like mixtures. Ferrets were trained to attend to a female voice in a mixture of two simultaneous, equally salient male and female voices. The animals reliably detected a target female word, both when present in the female stream alone, or when embedded in a male/female voice mixture. Neural representation of the stimuli was recorded in single neurons in the primary and secondary ferret auditory cortical fields, as well as in the frontal cortex. During task performance, representation of the female words became more enhanced relative to those of the (distractor) male in all the cortical regions, especially in the higher auditory cortical field. Analysis of the temporal and spectral response characteristics during task performance reveals how speech segregation gradually emerges in the auditory cortex. A computational model evaluated on the same voice mixtures replicates and extends these results to different attentional targets (attention to female or male voices). These findings are consistent with the temporal coherence theory whereby attention to a target voice anchors neural activity in cortical networks hence binding together channels that are coherent with the target, and ultimately forming a common auditory stream. The experimental and modeling results shed light on neural correlates of streaming percepts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The motor learning theory anticipates that cerebro-cerebellar loops perform sensorimotor prediction thereby regulating motor control. This operation has been identified during action execution (AE) and observation (AO) but the causal interaction between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex remained unclear. Here we used Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) to study functional MRI (fMRI) data obtained during a squeeze ball task in either the AE or AO conditions. In both cases, active regions included bilateral primary visual cortex (V1), left primary motor cortex (M1), left supplementary motor and premotor cortex (SMAPMC), left cingulate cortex (CC), left superior parietal lobule (SPL), and right cerebellum (CRBL). AE and AO networks showed the same fixed effective connectivity, with pathways between V1, CRBL, SMAPMC and CC wired in a closed loop. However, the cerebellar communication towards the cerebral cortex switched from excitatory in AE to inhibitory in AO. Moreover, in AE only, signal modulation was non-linear from SMAPMC to CRBL and within the CRBL self-connection, supporting the role of the CRBL in elaborating motor plans received from SMAPMC. Thus, the need for motor planning and the presence of a sensorimotor feedback in AE discriminate the modality of forward control operated by the CRBL on SMAPMC. While the underlying circuit mechanisms remain to be determined, these results reveal that the CRBL differentially controls the excitatory/inhibitory dynamics of inter-regional effective connectivity depending on its functional engagement, opening new prospective for the design of artificial sensorimotor controllers and for the investigation of neurological diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

These can display preferential resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Single-cell analyses can help elucidate Master Regulator (MR) proteins responsible for governing the transcriptional state of these cells, thus revealing complementary dependencies that may be leveraged via combination therapy. Interrogation of single-cell RNA sequencing profiles from seven metastatic breast cancer patients, using perturbational profiles of clinically relevant drugs, identified drugs predicted to invert the activity of MR proteins governing the transcriptional state of chemoresistant CSLCs, which were then validated by CROP-seq assays. The top drug, the anthelmintic albendazole, depleted this subpopulation in vivo without noticeable cytotoxicity. Moreover, sequential cycles of albendazole and paclitaxel{\textemdash}a commonly used chemotherapeutic {\textemdash}displayed significant synergy in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a TNBC patient, suggesting that network-based approaches can help develop mechanism-based combinatorial therapies targeting complementary subpopulations.Statement of significance Network-based approaches, as shown in a study on metastatic breast cancer, can develop effective combinatorial therapies targeting complementary subpopulations. By analyzing scRNA-seq data and using clinically relevant drugs, researchers identified and depleted chemoresistant Cancer Stem-Like Cells, enhancing the efficacy of standard chemotherapies.Competing Interest StatementP.A.S. receives patent royalties from Guardant Health.

	abstract = {Interception, a fundamental visuomotor skill for activities such as driving and sports, involves two main strategies: predictive, anticipating the target{\textquoteright}s trajectory, and prospective, actively tracking and adjusting movement. Experimentally controlled factors could potentially influence the relative usage of these strategies. We designed a visuomotor task to probe the relationship between target predictability and interception strategies. We manipulated stimulus predictability through controlled adjustments of external forces, altering the target{\textquoteright}s trajectory. We also manipulated the availability of perceptual information by introducing spatial occlusion at specific parts of the visual field. Our observations indicate that decreased target variability promoted predictive interception, whereas increased variability prompted a shift toward prospective strategies. Notably, hand-catching trajectories exhibited increased curvature in response to changes in target variability, whereas eye trajectories displayed a relatively consistent curvature across trials. Similarly, heightened target variability resulted in delayed onset of hand movements while showing no discernible alterations in the onset of eye movements. Thus, gaze position was a poor predictor of hand position, highlighting distinct adaptive patterns for hand and eye movements in response to task unpredictability. Finally, participants exhibited consistent interception strategies within and across sessions, highlighting their differences and preferences for predictive or prospective strategies. These results reveal a dynamic interplay between target predictability and interception, suggesting a flexible combination of both approaches. Examining how humans integrate sensory information, plan, and execute movements provides a unique opportunity to characterize predictive and prospective interception strategies in dynamic, real-world scenarios.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in cognition is a frequently studied yet highly debated topic in neuroscience. Most authors agree that the dACC is involved in either cognitive control (e.g. voluntary inhibition of automatic responses) or monitoring (e.g. comparing expectations with outcomes, detecting errors, tracking surprise). A consensus on which theoretical perspective best explains dACC contribution to behaviour is still lacking. In a recent neuroimaging study, the experimental predictions of two prominent models formalizing the cognitive control hypothesis (Expected Value of Control, EVC) and the monitoring hypothesis (Predicted Response Outcome, PRO) have been tested using a behavioural task involving both monitoring and cognitive control mechanisms. The results indicated that of the two tested models, only the PRO model effectively predicted the dACC activity, indicating surprise tracking for performance monitoring as the key sole underlying mechanism, even when cognitive control was required by the task at hand. These findings challenged the long-standing and established cognitive control hypothesis of dACC function and opened a theory crisis: the proposed surprise-monitoring hypothesis indeed cannot account for a wide array of previous experimental findings evidencing dACC activation in tasks requiring cognitive control without involving monitoring or surprise. Here we propose a novel hypothesis on dACC function that integrates both the monitoring and the cognitive control perspective in a unifying coherent framework, based on meta-Reinforcement Learning. Our model, the Reinforcement Meta Learner (RML), optimizes cognitive control - as in control models like EVC-by meta-learning based on tracking surprise - as in monitoring models like PRO. We tested RML experimental predictions with the same behavioural task used to compare the PRO and EVC models, and showed that RML predictions on dACC activity matched PRO predictions and outperformed EVC predictions. However, crucially, the RML simultaneously accounts for both cognitive control and monitoring functions, resolving the theoretical impasse about dACC function within an integrative framework. In sum, our results suggest that dACC function can be framed as a meta-learning optimiser of cognitive control, providing an integrative perspective on its roles in cognitive control, surprise tracking, and performance monitoring.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Targeted kinase inhibitors are a cornerstone of cancer therapy, but their success is often hindered by the complexity of cellular signaling networks that can lead to resistance. Overcoming this challenge necessitates a deep understanding of cellular signaling responses. While standard global phosphoproteomics offers extensive insights, lengthy processing times, the complexity of data interpretation, and frequent omission of crucial phosphorylation sites limit its utility. Here, we combine data-independent acquisition (DIA) with spike-in of synthetic heavy stable isotope-labeled phosphopeptides to facilitate the targeted detection of particularly informative phosphorylation sites. Our spike-in enhanced detection in DIA (SPIED-DIA) approach integrates the improved sensitivity of spike-in-based targeted detection with the discovery potential of global phosphoproteomics into a simple workflow. We employed this method to investigate synergistic signaling responses in colorectal cancer cell lines following MEK inhibition. Our findings highlight that combining MEK inhibition with growth factor stimulation synergistically activates JNK signaling in HCT116 cells. This synergy emphasizes the therapeutic potential of concurrently targeting MEK and JNK pathways, as evidenced by the significantly impaired growth of HCT116 cells when treated with both inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that SPIED-DIA effectively identifies synergistic signaling responses in colorectal cancer cells, presenting a valuable tool for uncovering new therapeutic targets and strategies in cancer treatment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The arousal systems of the brainstem, specifically the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system, respond {\textquotedblleft}phasically{\textquotedblright} during decisions. These central arousal transients are accompanied by dilations of the pupil. Mechanistic attempts to understand the impact of phasic arousal on cognition would benefit from the ability to experimentally manipulate arousal in a temporally precise manner. Here, we evaluated a non-invasive candidate approach for such a manipulation in humans: presenting task-irrelevant auditory stimuli at different latencies during the execution of a challenging task. Task-irrelevant auditory stimuli drive responses of brainstem nuclei involved in the control of pupil size. But it is unknown whether such sound-evoked responses mimic the central arousal transients evoked during cognitive computations. A large body of evidence has implicated central arousal transients in a bias reduction during challenging perceptual decisions. We thus used challenging visual decisions as a testbed, combining them with task-irrelevant sounds of varying onset latency or duration. Across three experiments, the sounds consistently elicited well-controlled pupil responses that superimposed onto task-evoked responses. While we replicated a negative correlation between task-evoked pupil responses and bias established in previous work, the task-irrelevant sounds had no behavioral effect. This dissociation suggests that cognitive task engagement and task-irrelevant sounds may recruit distinct neural systems contributing to the control of pupil size.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Music can convey basic emotions, such as joy and sadness, and more complex ones, such as tenderness or nostalgia. Its effects on emotion regulation and reward have attracted much attention in cognitive and affective neuroscience. Understanding the neural correlates of music-evoked emotions may guide the development of neurorehabilitation interventions based on music. Here, we used fMRI to examine the relationship between the classification of music excerpts regarding perceived valence and arousal and their neural correlates. Twenty participants were scanned while listening to 96 musical excerpts, which were classified beforehand into four categories as a function of valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (high vs. low). Differences in valence and arousal modulated activity in cortical regions, most noticeably the music-specific subregions of the auditory cortex, but also in the thalamus and regions of the reward network such as the amygdala. Using multivoxel pattern analysis, we created a computational model able to decode the valence and arousal of the music excerpts significantly above chance. We further explored how a set of musical features relate to brain activity in valence-, arousal-, reward-, and auditory-related ROIs. The results emphasize the differential involvement of musical features in the brain, notably expressive features such as Vibrato and Tonal and Spectral dissonance in valence, arousal, and reward brain networks, while a broader set of features modulate sensory auditory networks. Using ecologically valid music stimuli, we contribute to the definition of the neural substrates of music listening and evoked emotions. Moreover, the definition of the musical features that modulate specific brain networks paves the way to developing novel music-based neurorehabilitation strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {A central challenge in the progression of a variety of open questions in biology, such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and development, is learning from empirical data how information is integrated to support tissue-level function and behavior. Information-theoretic approaches provide a quantitative framework for extracting patterns from data, but so far have been predominantly applied to neuronal systems at the tissue-level. Here, we demonstrate how time series of Ca2+ dynamics can be used to identify the structure and information dynamics of other biological tissues. To this end, we expressed the calcium reporter GCaMP6s in an organoid system of explanted amphibian epidermis derived from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, and imaged calcium activity pre- and post- a puncture injury, for six replicate organoids. We constructed functional connectivity networks by computing mutual information between cells from time series derived using medical imaging techniques to track intracellular Ca2+. We analyzed network properties including degree distribution, spatial embedding, and modular structure. We find organoid networks exhibit more connectivity than null models, with high degree hubs and mesoscale community structure with spatial clustering. Utilizing functional connectivity networks, we show the tissue retains non-random features after injury, displays long range correlations and structure, and non-trivial clustering that is not necessarily spatially dependent. Our results suggest increased integration after injury, possible cellular coordination in response to injury, and some type of generative structure of the anatomy. While we study Ca2+ in Xenopus epidermal cells, our computational approach and analyses highlight how methods developed to analyze functional connectivity in neuronal tissues can be generalized to any tissue and fluorescent signal type. Our framework therefore provides a bridge between neuroscience and more basal modes of information processing.Author summary A central challenge in understanding several diverse processes in biology, including morphogenesis, wound healing, and development, is learning from empirical data how information is integrated to support tissue-level function and behavior. Significant progress in understanding information integration has occurred in neuroscience via the use of observable live calcium reporters throughout neural tissues. However, these same techniques have seen limited use in the non-neural tissues of multicellular organisms despite similarities in tissue communication. Here we utilize methods designed for neural tissues and modify them to work on any tissue type, demonstrating how non-neural tissues also contain non-random and potentially meaningful structures to be gleaned from information theoretic approaches. In the case of epidermal tissue derived from developing amphibians, we find non-trivial informational structure over greater spatial and temporal scales than those found in neural tissue. This hints at how more exploration into information structures within these tissue types could provide a deeper understanding into information processing within living systems beyond the nervous system.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Interactions between top-down attention and bottom-up visceral inputs are assumed to produce conscious perceptions of interoceptive states, and while each process has been independently associated with aberrant interoceptive symptomatology in psychiatric disorders, the neural substrates of this interface are unknown. We conducted a preregistered functional neuroimaging study of 46 individuals with anxiety, depression, and/or eating disorders (ADE) and 46 propensity-matched healthy comparisons (HC), comparing their neural activity across two interoceptive tasks differentially recruiting top-down or bottom-up processing within the same scan session. During an interoceptive attention task, top-down attention was voluntarily directed towards cardiorespiratory or visual signals, whereas during an interoceptive perturbation task, intravenous infusions of isoproterenol (a peripherally-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist) were administered in a double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to drive bottom-up cardiorespiratory sensations. Across both tasks, neural activation converged upon the insular cortex, localizing within the granular and ventral dysgranular subregions bilaterally. However, contrasting hemispheric differences emerged, with the ADE group exhibiting (relative to HCs) an asymmetric pattern of overlap in the left insula, with increased or decreased proportions of co-activated voxels within the left or right dysgranular insula, respectively. The ADE group also showed less agranular anterior insula activation during periods of bodily uncertainty (i.e., when anticipating possible isoproterenol-induced changes that never arrived). Finally, post-task changes in insula functional connectivity were associated with anxiety and depression severity. These findings confirm the dysgranular mid-insula as a key cortical interface where attention and prediction meet real-time bodily inputs, especially during heightened awareness of interoceptive states. Further, the dysgranular mid-insula may indeed be a {\textquotedblleft}locus of disruption{\textquotedblright} for psychiatric disorders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) remains a particularly difficult cancer to treat, and survival outcomes remain poor. In addition to the lack of dedicated drug discovery programs for GBM, extensive intratumor heterogeneity and epigenetic plasticity related to cell-state transitions are major roadblocks to successful drug therapy in GBM. To study these phenomenon, publicly available snRNAseq and bulk RNAseq data from patient samples were used to categorize cells from patients into four cell states (i.e. phenotypes), namely: (i) neural progenitor-like (NPC-like), (ii) oligodendrocyte progenitor-like (OPC-like), (iii) astrocyte-like (AC-like), and (iv) mesenchymal-like (MES-like). Patients were subsequently grouped into subpopulations based on which cell-state was the most dominant in their respective tumor. By incorporating phosphoproteomic measurements from the same patients, a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) was constructed for each cell state. These four-cell state PPINs were pooled to form a single Boolean network that was used for in silico protein knockout simulations to investigate mechanisms that either promote or prevent cell state transitions. Simulation results were input into a boosted tree machine learning model which predicted the cell states or phenotypes of GBM patients from an independent public data source, the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) Consortium. Combining the simulation results and the machine learning predictions, we generated hypotheses for clinically relevant causal mechanisms of cell state transitions. For example, the transcription factor TFAP2A can be seen to promote a transition from the NPC-like to the MES-like state. Such protein nodes and the associated signaling pathways provide potential drug targets that can be further tested in vitro and support cell state-directed (CSD) therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Understanding the neurocomputational mechanisms of biased belief updating may help to counteract maladaptive beliefs. The present study uses functional neuroimaging to examine neural activity associated with prediction error-based learning in depression and healthy controls. We hypothesized that increasing symptom burden is associated with negatively biased self-belief formation and altered neural tracking of social feedback. Results showed that a higher symptom burden was associated with forming more negative self-beliefs and more positive beliefs about others. This bias was driven by reduced learning from positive prediction errors in depression. Neural reactivity of the insula showed increased tracking of more negative self-related prediction errors. The interplay of increased neural responsiveness to negative feedback and reduced learning from positive feedback may contribute to the persistence of maladaptive self-beliefs and, thus, the maintenance of depression.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The extent to which the brain predicts upcoming information during language processing remains controversial. To shed light on this debate, the present study reanalysed Nieuwland and colleagues{\textquoteright} (2018) replication of DeLong et al. (2005). Participants (N = 356) viewed sentences containing articles and nouns of varying predictability, while their electroencephalogram was recorded. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) preceding the critical words (namely the semantic prediction potential; SPP), in conjunction with post-word N400 patterns and individual neural metrics. ERP activity was compared with two measures of word predictability: cloze probability and lexical surprisal. In contrast to prior literature, SPP amplitudes did not increase as cloze probability increased, suggesting that the component may not reflect prediction during natural language processing. Initial N400 results at the article provided evidence against phonological prediction in language, in line with Nieuwland and colleagues{\textquoteright} findings. Strikingly however, when the surprisal of the prior words in the sentence was included in the analysis, increases in article surprisal were associated with increased N400 amplitudes, consistent with prediction accounts. This relationship between surprisal and N400 amplitude was not observed when the surprisal of the two prior words was low, suggesting that expectation violations at the article may be overlooked under highly predictable conditions. Individual alpha frequency (IAF) also modulated the relationship between article surprisal and the N400, emphasising the importance of individual neural factors for prediction. The present study extends upon existing neurocognitive models of language and prediction more generally, by illuminating the flexible and subject-specific nature of predictive processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

It investigates the relationship between structural and statistical language knowledge in brain dynamics, focusing on phase and amplitude modulation. Using syntactic features from constituent hierarchies and surface statistics from a transformer model as predictors of forward encoding models, we reconstructed cross-frequency neural dynamics from MEG data during audiobook listening. Our findings challenge a strict separation of linguistic structure and statistics in the brain, with both aiding neural signal reconstruction. Syntactic features had a more temporally spread impact, and both word entropy and the number of closing syntactic constituents were linked to the phase-amplitude coupling of neural dynamics, implying a role in temporal prediction and cortical oscillation alignment during speech processing. Our results indicate that structured and statistical information jointly shape neural dynamics during spoken language comprehension and suggest an integration process via a cross-frequency coupling mechanism.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

This study explores the neural intricacies underpinning robust speech comprehension, giving computational mechanistic proof for the hypothesis proposing a pivotal role for rhythmic, predictive top-down contextualization facilitated by the delta rhythm in achieving time-invariant speech processing. Our Brain-Rhythm-based Inference model, BRyBI, integrates three key rhythmic processes {\textendash} theta-gamma interactions for parsing phoneme sequences, dynamic delta rhythm for inferred prosodic-phrase context, and resilient speech representations. Demonstrating mechanistic proof-of-principle, BRyBI replicates human behavioral experiments, showcasing its ability to handle pitch variations, time-warped speech, interruptions, and silences in non-comprehensible contexts. Intriguingly, the model aligns with human experiments, revealing optimal silence time scales in the theta- and delta-frequency ranges. Comparative analysis with deep neural network language models highlights distinctive performance patterns, emphasizing the unique capabilities of a rhythmic framework.

However, recent innovative work has added further nuance to this idea, showing how muscles may also work together towards functionally different and independent task-goals, representing crucial attributes of flexible motor behaviour. Here we probed this proposed functional neural architecture by building upon an established theoretical framework to characterise distinct types of muscle interactions, i.e. functionally similar, complementary and independent, across scales. Through a novel application of the Partial Information Decomposition to large-scale muscle activations, we unveiled complex networks of inter- and intra-muscular interactions with distinct functional roles as well as independent muscle contributions to task performance. We showcased the effectiveness of this approach by extracting hierarchical and functionally diverse motor components that were a) generalisable across participants and tasks and b) predictive of balance performance across trials and of differences in motor variability between young and older adults. In aligning muscle synergy analysis with the forefront of understanding on human movement modularity, our findings suggest the proposed methodology can offer novel mechanistic insights into movement control and research opportunities towards health and engineering applications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affects the cerebral cortex layer-dependently, most notably by the foremost targeting of upper motor neurons (UMNs) sited in layer Vb. Previous studies have shown a retained ability of paralysed patients to activate residual cortical motor networks, even in late-stage ALS. However, it is currently unknown whether such activation reflects a retained capacity to process sensorimotor inputs or if it is a result of actual motor output. Given the distinct function of individual cortical layers, layer-specific functional measurements may provide insight to this question. In this study, using submillimetre resolution laminar fMRI, we assessed the layer-dependent activation associated with attempted (motor) and passive (somatosensory) movements in a locked-in stage ALS patient. We found robust activation in both superficial and deep layers of primary motor cortex. The peak activation in deep layers was localised to layer Vb. These findings demonstrate preserved activity in deep output layers of M1, possibly reflecting a retained ability to engage residual UMNs despite years of paralysis. Our study underscores the capacity of laminar fMRI to discern subtle cortical activity and elucidates a promising pathway for probing in vivo human ALS pathology with unprecedented resolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Pain perception is influenced not only by sensory input from afferent neurons but also by cognitive factors such as prior expectations. It has been suggested that overly precise priors may be a key contributing factor to chronic pain states such as neuropathic pain. However, it remains an open question how overly precise priors in favor of pain might arise. Here, we first verify that a Bayesian approach can describe how statistical integration of prior expectations and sensory input results in pain phenomena such as placebo hypoalgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, chronic pain, and spontaneous neuropathic pain. Our results indicate that the value of the prior, which is determined by generative model parameters, may be a key contributor to these phenomena. Next, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian approach to update the parameters of the generative model based on the difference between the predicted and the perceived pain, to reflect that people integrate prior experiences in their future expectations. In contrast with simpler approaches, this hierarchical model structure is able to show for placebo hypoalgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia how these phenomena can arise from prior experiences in the form of a classical conditioning procedure. We also demonstrate the phenomenon of offset analgesia, in which a disproportionally large pain decrease is obtained following a minor reduction in noxious stimulus intensity. Finally, we turn to simulations of neuropathic pain, where our hierarchical model corroborates that persistent non-neuropathic pain is a risk factor for developing neuropathic pain following denervation, and additionally offers an interesting prediction that complete absence of informative painful experiences could be a similar risk factor. Taken together, these results provide insight to how prior experiences may contribute to pain perception, in both experimental and neuropathic pain, which in turn might be informative for improving strategies of pain prevention and relief.Author summary To efficiently navigate the world and avoid harmful situations, it is beneficial to learn from prior pain experiences. This learning process typically results in certain contexts being associated with an expected level of pain, which subsequently influences pain perception. While this process of pain anticipation has evolved as a mechanism for avoiding harm, recent research indicates overly precise expectations of pain may in fact contribute to certain chronic pain conditions, in which pain persists even after tissue damage has healed, or even arises without any initiating injury. However, it remains an open question how prior experiences contribute to such overly precise expectations of pain. Here, we mathematically model the pain-learning-process. Our model successfully describes several counterintuitive but well-documented pain phenomena. We also make predictions of how prior experiences may contribute the perception of pain and how the same learning process could be leveraged to improve strategies of pain prevention and relief.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Our use of language, which is profoundly social in nature, essentially takes place in interactive contexts and is shaped by precise coordination dynamics that interlocutors must observe. Thus language interaction is high demanding on fast adjustment of speech production. Here, we developed a real-time coupled-oscillators virtual partner that allows - by changing the coupling strength parameters - to modulate the ability to synchronise speech with a speaker. Then, we recorded the intracranial brain activity of 16 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy while they performed a verbal coordination task with the virtual partner (VP). More precisely, patients had to repeat short sentences synchronously with the VP. This synchronous speech task is efficient to highlight both the dorsal and ventral language pathways. Importantly, combining time-resolved verbal coordination and neural activity shows more spatially differentiated patterns and different types of neural sensitivity along the dorsal pathway. More precisely, high-frequency activity in secondary auditory regions is highly sensitive to verbal coordinative dynamics, while primary regions are not. Finally, the high-frequency activity of the IFG BA44 seems to specifically index the online coordinative adjustments that are continuously required to compensate deviation from synchronisation. These findings illustrate the possibility and value of using a fully dynamic, adaptive and interactive language task to gather deeper understanding of the subtending neural dynamics involved in speech perception, production as well as their interaction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {A key function of brain systems mediating emotion is to learn to anticipate unpleasant experiences based on predictive sensory cues in the environment. While organisms readily associate sensory stimuli with aversive outcomes, higher-order forms of emotional learning and memory require inference to extrapolate the circumstances surrounding directly experienced aversive events to other indirectly related contexts and sensory patterns which weren{\textquoteright}t a part of the original experience. To achieve this type of learning requires internal models of emotion which flexibly track directly experienced and inferred aversive associations. While the brain mechanisms of simple forms of aversive learning have been well studied in areas such as the amygdala, whether and how the brain represents internal models of emotionally relevant associations is not known. Here we report that neurons in the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) encode an internal model of emotion by linking sensory stimuli in the environment with aversive events, whether they were directly or indirectly associated with that experience. These representations are flexible, and updating the behavioral significance of individual features of the association selectively modifies corresponding dmPFC representations. While dmPFC population activity encodes all salient associations, dmPFC neurons projecting to the amygdala specifically represent and are required to express inferred associations. Together, these findings reveal how internal models of emotion are encoded in dmPFC to regulate subcortical systems for recall of inferred emotional memories.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

According to latent state theories, this is determined by the level of surprise, or prediction error, generated by the new information: small prediction error leads to updating of existing memory, large prediction error leads to encoding of a new memory. We tested this idea using a protocol in which rats were first conditioned to fear a stimulus paired with shock. The stimulus was then gradually extinguished by progressively reducing the shock intensity until the stimulus was presented alone. Consistent with latent state theories, this gradual extinction protocol (small prediction errors) was better than standard extinction (large prediction errors) in producing long-term suppression of fear responses; and the benefit of gradual extinction was due to updating of the conditioning memory with information about extinction. Thus, prediction error determines how new information is organized in memory, and latent state theories adequately describe the ways in which this occurs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Computational modeling of behaviour identified a parametric signature, characterized most notably by increased punishment sensitivity. This signature is distinct from patterns previously reported in psychiatric conditions and it aligns with predictions of mechanistic models of chronic pain such as the fear avoidance model. Neural activity associated with the punishment prediction error was enhanced in the right posterior insular cortex, putamen, pallidum, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional network connectivity analysis showed that insula centrality correlated with subjective reports of fatigue and pain.

	abstract = {Serotonergic psychedelics have been identified as promising next-generation therapeutic agents in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. While their efficacy has been increasingly validated, the mechanism by which they exert a therapeutic effect is still debated. A popular theoretical account is that excessive 5-HT2a agonism disrupts cortical dynamics, relaxing the precision of maladaptive highlevel beliefs, thus making them more malleable and open to revision. We extend this perspective by developing a theoretical framework and simulations based on predictive processing and an energy-based model of cortical dynamics. We consider the role of both 5-HT2a and 5-HT1a agonism, characterizing 5-HT2a agonism as inducing stochastic perturbations of the energy function underlying cortical dynamics and 5-HT1a agonism as inducing a global smoothing of that function. Within our simulations, we find that while both agonists are able to provide a significant therapeutic effect individually, mixed agonists provide both a more psychologically tolerable acute experience and better therapeutic efficacy than either pure 5HT2a or 5-HT1a agonists alone. This finding provides a potential theoretical basis for the clinical success of LSD, psilocybin, and DMT, all of which are mixed serotonin agonists. Our results furthermore indicate that exploring the design space of biased 5-HT1a agonist psychedelics such as 5-MeO-DMT may prove fruitful in the development of even more effective and tolerable psychotherapeutic agents in the future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) report stress when acting in a familiar probabilistic environment, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Their decision-making may be affected by the uncertainty aversion implicated in ASD, and associated with increased autonomic arousal. Previous studies have shown that in neurotypical (NT) people, decisions with predictably better outcomes are less stressful and elicit smaller pupil-linked arousal than those involving random {\textquotedblleft}trial-and-error{\textquotedblright} searches or self-imposed risk of exploration. Here, in a sample of 46 high-functioning ASD and NT participants, we explored pupil-linked arousal and behavioral performance in a probabilistic reward learning task with a stable advantage of one choice option over the other. Using mixed-effects model analysis, we contrasted pupil dilation response (PDR) between a preferred frequently rewarded exploitative decision and its explorative alternatives. We observed that subjects with ASD learned the advantageous probabilistic choices at the same rate over time and preferred them to the same degree as NT participants both in terms of choice ratio and decision speed. Despite similar reward prediction abilities, outcome predictability modulated decision-related PDR in ASD in the opposite direction than in NT individuals. Moreover, relatively enhanced PDR elicited by exploitative low-risk decisions predicted a greater degree of self-reported intolerance of uncertainty in everyday life. Our results suggest that in a non-volatile probabilistic environment, objectively good predictive abilities in people with ASD are coupled with elevated physiological stress and subjective uncertainty regarding the decisions with the best possible but still uncertain outcome that contributes to their intolerance of uncertainty.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Impulsive choices are a critical aspect of substance use disorders and maladaptive decision-making across the lifespan. Here, we sought to understand the neuronal underpinnings of expected reward and risk estimation on a trial-by-trial basis during impulsive choices. To do so, we acquired electrical recordings from the human brain while participants carried out a risky decision-making task designed to measure choice impulsivity. Behaviorally, we found a reward-accuracy tradeoff, whereby more impulsive choosers were more accurate at the task, opting for a more immediate reward while compromising overall task performance. We then examined how neuronal populations across frontal, temporal, and limbic brain regions parametrically encoded reinforcement learning model variables, namely reward and risk expectation and surprise, across trials. We found more widespread representations of reward value expectation and prediction error in more impulsive choosers, whereas less impulsive choosers preferentially represented risk expectation. A regional analysis of reward and risk encoding highlighted the anterior cingulate cortex for value expectation, the anterior insula for risk expectation and surprise, and distinct regional encoding between impulsivity groups. Beyond describing trial-by-trial population neuronal representations of reward and risk variables, these results suggest impaired inhibitory control and model-free learning underpinnings of impulsive choice. These findings shed light on neural processes underlying reinforced learning and decision-making in uncertain environments and how these processes may function in psychiatric disorders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Sleep is an essential behavior that supports lifelong brain health and cognition. Neuronal synapses are a major target for restorative sleep function and a locus of dysfunction in response to sleep deprivation (SD). Synapse density is highly dynamic during development, becoming stabilized with maturation to adulthood, suggesting sleep exerts distinct synaptic functions between development and adulthood. Importantly, problems with sleep are common in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, early life sleep disruption in animal models causes long lasting changes in adult behavior. Different plasticity engaged during sleep necessarily implies that developing and adult synapses will show differential vulnerability to SD. To investigate distinct sleep functions and mechanisms of vulnerability to SD across development, we systematically examined the behavioral and molecular responses to acute SD between juvenile (P21-28), adolescent (P42-49) and adult (P70-100) mice of both sexes. Compared to adults, juveniles lack robust adaptations to SD, precipitating cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition test. Subcellular fractionation, combined with proteome and phosphoproteome analysis revealed the developing synapse is profoundly vulnerable to SD, whereas adults exhibit comparative resilience. SD in juveniles, and not older mice, aberrantly drives induction of synapse potentiation, synaptogenesis, and expression of peri-neuronal nets. Our analysis further reveals the developing synapse as a convergent node between vulnerability to SD and ASD genetic risk. Together, our systematic analysis supports a distinct developmental function of sleep and reveals how sleep disruption impacts key aspects of brain development, providing mechanistic insights for ASD susceptibility.Significance Statement Sleep is a fundamental pillar of lifelong health. Sleep disruption is commonly associated with neurodevelopmental conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Therefore, understanding the vulnerabilities associated with developmental sleep loss is an essential research question. Here we systemically examine the molecular and behavioral consequence of sleep deprivation (SD) in developing and adult mice. Compared to adults, developing mice show absent or blunted adaptive responses to SD, and heightened sensitivity to SD-induced cognitive deficits. Our molecular analysis indicates sleep plays an important role in key aspects of brain development including synaptogenesis, and that the effects of SD converge on nodes of genetic risk for ASD. This study provides new insights into the role of sleep in healthy brain development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {As emerging technologies enable measurement of precise details of the activity within microcircuits at ever-increasing scales, there is a growing need to identify the salient features and patterns within the neural populations that represent physiologically and behaviorally relevant aspects of the network. Accumulating evidence from recordings of large neural populations suggests that neural population activity frequently exhibits relatively low-dimensional structure, with a small number of variables explaining a substantial fraction of the structure of the activity. While such structure has been observed across the brain, it is not known how reduced-dimension representations of neural population activity relate to classical metrics of {\textquotedblleft}brain state,{\textquotedblright} typically described in terms of fluctuations in the local field potential (LFP), single-cell activity, and behavioral metrics. Here, we relate the latent dynamics of spiking activity of populations of neurons in the whisker area of primary somatosensory cortex of awake mice to classic measurements of cortical state in S1. We found that a hidden Markov model fit the population spiking data well with a relatively small number of states, and that putative inhibitory neurons played an outsize role in determining the latent state dynamics. Spiking states inferred from the model were more informative of the cortical state than a direct readout of the spiking activity of single neurons or of the population. Further, the spiking states predicted both the trial-by-trial variability in sensory responses and one aspect of behavior, whisking activity. Our results show how classical measurements of brain state relate to neural population spiking dynamics at the scale of the microcircuit and provide an approach for quantitative mapping of brain state dynamics across brain areas.Author Summary Brain states have long been known to strongly shape sensory perception, decision making, cognition, and movement. Brain state during wakefulness changes constantly, classically assessed using changes in the spectral features of the local field potential (LFP) and behavioral measures. However, the connection between these classical measurements of brain state and the collective dynamics of populations of neurons is unclear. Here we fit a latent-variable model to population spiking activity, finding that latent variables inferred under the model are highly predictive of cortical state changes and that the latent dynamics are profoundly shaped by inhibitory cell activity. Our approach connects the activity patterns of ensembles of neurons to a classical measurement of brain state and opens new avenues for investigating brain state dynamics across diverse cortical areas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

It increased feeding before anticipated food shortages, explaining predictive energy regulation (allostasis) in animals.

	abstract = {Recognizing goal-directed actions is a computationally challenging task, requiring not only the visual analysis of body movements, but also analysis of how these movements causally impact, and thereby induce a change in, those objects targeted by an action. We tested the hypothesis that the analysis of body movements and the effects they induce relies on distinct neural representations in superior and anterior inferior parietal lobe (SPL and aIPL). In four fMRI sessions, participants observed videos of actions (e.g. breaking stick, squashing plastic bottle) along with corresponding point-light-display stick figures, pantomimes, and abstract animations of agent-object interactions (e.g. dividing or compressing a circle). Cross-decoding between actions and animations revealed that aIPL encodes abstract representations of action effect structures independent of motion and object identity. By contrast, cross-decoding between actions and point-light-displays revealed that SPL is disproportionally tuned to body movements independent of visible Interactions with objects. Lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) was sensitive to both action effects and body movements. Moreover, cross-decoding between pantomimes and animations revealed that right aIPL and LOTC represent action effects even in response to implied object interactions. These results demonstrate that parietal cortex and LOTC are tuned to physical action features, such as how body parts move in space relative to each other and how body parts interact with objects to induce a change (e.g. in position or shape/configuration). The high level of abstraction revealed by cross-decoding suggests a general neural code supporting mechanical reasoning about how entities interact with, and have effects on, each other.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) involves altered reward processing and decision-making, with inconsistencies across studies. Here, we integrated hierarchical Bayesian modelling with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterise maladaptive belief updating in this condition. First, we determined if previously reported increased learning rates in BD stem from a heightened expectation of environmental changes. Additionally, we examined if this increased expectation speeds up belief updating in decision-making, associated with modulation of rhythmic neural activity within the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortex (PFC, OFC, ACC). Twenty-two 22 euthymic BD and 27 healthy control (HC) participants completed a reward-based motor decision-making task in a volatile setting. Hierarchical Bayesian modelling revealed BD participants anticipated greater environmental volatility, resulting in a more stochastic mapping from beliefs to actions and paralleled by lower win rates and a reduced tendency to repeat rewarded actions than HC. Despite this, BD individuals adjusted their expectations of action-outcome contingencies more slowly, but both groups invigorated their actions similarly. On a neural level, while healthy individuals exhibited an alpha-beta suppression and gamma increase during belief updating, BD participants showed dampened effects, extending across the PFC, OFC, and ACC regions. This was accompanied by an abnormally increased beta-band directed information flow in BD. Overall, the results suggest euthymic BD individuals anticipate environmental change without adequately learning from it, contributing to maladaptive belief updating. Alterations in frequency-domain amplitude and functional connectivity within the PFC, OFC, and ACC during belief updating underlie the computational effects and could serve as potential indicators for predicting relapse in future research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Storytelling has been pivotal for the transmission of knowledge and cultural norms across human history. A crucial process underlying the generation of narratives is the exertion of cognitive control on the semantic representations stored in memory, a phenomenon referred as semantic control. Despite the extensive literature investigating the neural mechanisms of semantic control in generative language tasks, little effort has been done towards storytelling under naturalistic conditions. Here, we probed human participants to generate stories in response to a set of instructions which triggered a narrative that was either appropriate (ordinary), novel (random), or balanced (creative), while recording functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal. By leveraging deep language models, we demonstrated how participants ideally balanced the level of semantic control during story generation. At the neural level, creative stories were differentiated by a multivariate pattern of neural activity in frontal cortices compared to ordinary ones and in fronto-temporo-parietal cortices with respect to randomly generated stories. Crucially, similar brain regions were also encoding the features that distinguished the stories behaviourally. Moreover, we decomposed the neural dynamics into connectome harmonic modes and found specific spatial frequency patterns underlying the modulation of semantic control during story generation. Finally, we found different functional coupling within and between the default mode, salience and control networks when contrasting creative stories with their controls. Together, our findings highlight the neural mechanisms underlying the regulation of semantic exploration during narrative ideation and contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural dynamics underpinning the role of semantic control in generative storytelling.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We examined a well-characterized large sample (151 participants) of monolinguals and bilinguals with varied age of second language acquisition, who underwent resting-state functional magnetic brain imaging. We constructed comprehensive functional brain networks for each participant, encompassing cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions of interest. Whole-brain analyses revealed that bilingual individuals exhibit higher global efficiency than monolinguals, indicating enhanced functional integration in the brain. Moreover, the age at which the second language was acquired correlated with this increased efficiency, suggesting that earlier exposure to a second language has lasting positive effects on brain functional organization. Further investigation through the network-based statistics (NBS) approach indicates that this effect is primarily driven by heightened functional connectivity between association networks and the cerebellum. This work shows that early learning enhances global whole-brain efficiency and that the timing of learning of two languages has an impact on functional brain organization.Significance statement Long-term learning impacts brain organization at different spatial scales, and this may be particularly enhanced during early stages of life. Bilingualism offers a unique opportunity to test long-term learning effects in the human brain, given that exposure to a second language can occur from birth or later in life, and can be maintained over long periods of time. We found that second language acquisition in early childhood (before five years of age) enhances brain network efficiency, and that this effect goes beyond the language and cognitive control regions, in fact, the interhemispheric cortico-cerebellar circuit plays a key role. This work shows that the timing of bilingual learning experience alters the brain functional organization at the global and local levels.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we show that two behavioral metrics {\textendash} reaction time (RT) and confidence {\textendash} can be decoded across the cortex when each individual is considered separately. Subjects (N=50) completed a perceptual decision-making task with confidence. We built models decoding trial-level RT and confidence separately for each subject using the activation patterns in one brain area at a time after splitting the entire cortex into 200 regions of interest (ROIs). At the group level, we replicated previous results by showing that both RT and confidence could be decoded from a small number of ROIs (12.0\% and 3.5\%, respectively). Critically, at the level of the individual, both RT and confidence could be decoded from most brain regions even after Bonferroni correction (90.0\% and 72.5\%, respectively). Surprisingly, we observed that many brain regions exhibited opposite brain-behavior relationships across individuals, such that, for example, higher activations predicted fast RTs in some subjects but slow RTs in others. These results were further replicated in a second dataset. Lastly, we developed a simple test to determine the robustness of decoding performance, which showed that several hundred trials per subject are required for robust decoding. These results show that behavioral signatures can be decoded from a much broader range of cortical areas than previously recognized and suggest the need to study the brain-behavior relationship at both the group and the individual level.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Oscillatory EEG signals contain both periodic and aperiodic (1/f components), segregating which is important for gaining insights into the underlying neural computations. Several studies have explored the periodic features underlying neural basis of emotion processing, while 1/f component is less explored. Hence, the present study sought to determine whether seeing emotionally laden music video clips have an impact on aperiodic components along with the periodic components and their underlying basis by conceptualizing a biophysically realistic computational model. Using the publicly available Data for Emotional Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) dataset we elucidate that there is a significant increase in exponent and offset of aperiodic background during high arousal compared to low arousal trials. In contrast, there were no discernible variations between the aperiodic components during the high and low valence categories. In high arousal, we also discovered reduction in alpha power in line with previous studies. Finally, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we employed a biophysically realistic and previously established thalamo-cortical model of neural field activity, which which allowed us to characterize that heightened emotional arousal appears emerge from an increased cooperation in information communication between neuronal populations in reticular and relay nuclei of thalamus.Significance statement Dissociation of emotion and valence and arousal is an established theory in affective neuroscience. Are these dimensions represented in aperiodic background of macrocscopic electrophysiological scales of EEG? We sought to ask this question in the publicly available DEAP data. Our findings of increased aperiodic components during high arousal in contrast to low arousal suggest heightened neural activity alongside an inhibitory influence. Using a neural field model of thalamo-cortical interactions reveals a mechanistic approach that suggests heightened arousal corresponds to an enhanced inhibitory coupling between thalamic reticular and relay neuronal populations. In essence, this study advances our understanding of the intricate relationship between electrophysiological signals and emotion dimensions, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying arousal-related emotional responses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {There is growing recognition of cortical involvement in nociception. The present study is motivated by predictive coding formulations of pain perception that stress the importance of top-down and bottom-up information flow in the brain. It compares forward and backward effective connectivity - estimated from resting-state fMRI - between chronic osteoarthritic patients and healthy control subjects. Additionally, it assesses differences in effective connectivity between placebo responders and non-responders and asks whether these differences can be used to predict pain perception and placebo response. To assess hierarchical processing in nociception, we defined two primary cortical regions: primary somatosensory cortex (SSC) and posterior insula (PI) (primary interoceptive cortex) and lateral frontal pole (FP1), a terminal relay station of the pain processing pathways. The directed (effective) connectivity within and between these regions were estimated using spectral dynamic causal modeling (DCM). 56 osteoarthritis patients and 18 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Within the patient group, effective connectivity was compared between placebo responders and non-responders.In osteoarthritic patients, contra control group, forward connectivity from SSC to FP1 and from PI to FP1 was enhanced in the left hemisphere. Backward connections from FP1 to SSC were more inhibitory. Intrinsic (i.e., inhibitory recurrent or self-connectivity) of left FP1 increased. In placebo responders compared to non-responders, forward connections from bilateral SSC to PI, left SSC to FP1, left PI to left FP1 were more inhibitory. In addition, self-connections of bilateral PI and top-down connections from right FP1 to right SSC were disinhibited; whereas self-connections of right FP1 became increasingly inhibitory. We confirmed the robustness of these results in a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis of (out-of-sample) effect sizes. Overall, effective extrinsic and intrinsic effective connectivity among higher and lower cortical regions involved in pain processing emerges as a promising and quantifiable candidate marker of nociception and placebo response. The significance of these findings for clinical practice and neuroscience are discussed in relation to predictive processing accounts of placebo effects and chronic pain.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {One of the key problems the brain faces is inferring the state of the world from a sequence of dynamically changing stimuli, and it is not yet clear how the sensory system achieves this task. A well-established computational framework for describing perceptual processes in the brain is provided by the theory of predictive coding. Although the original proposals of predictive coding have discussed temporal prediction, later work developing this theory mostly focused on static stimuli, and key questions on neural implementation and computational properties of temporal predictive coding networks remain open. Here, we address these questions and present a formulation of the temporal predictive coding model that can be naturally implemented in recurrent networks, in which activity dynamics rely only on local inputs to the neurons, and learning only utilises local Hebbian plasticity. Additionally, we show that temporal predictive coding networks can approximate the performance of the Kalman filter in predicting behaviour of linear systems, and behave as a variant of a Kalman filter which does not track its own subjective posterior variance. Importantly, temporal predictive coding networks can achieve similar accuracy as the Kalman filter without performing complex mathematical operations, but just employing simple computations that can be implemented by biological networks. Moreover, when trained with natural dynamic inputs, we found that temporal predictive coding can produce Gabor-like, motion-sensitive receptive fields resembling those observed in real neurons in visual areas. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be effectively generalized to nonlinear systems. Overall, models presented in this paper show how biologically plausible circuits can predict future stimuli and may guide research on understanding specific neural circuits in brain areas involved in temporal prediction.Author summary While significant advances have been made in the neuroscience of how the brain processes static stimuli, the time dimension has often been relatively neglected. However, time is crucial since the stimuli perceived by our senses typically dynamically vary in time, and the cortex needs to make sense of these changing inputs. This paper describes a computational model of cortical networks processing temporal stimuli. This model is able to infer and track the state of the environment based on noisy inputs, and predict future sensory stimuli. By ensuring that these predictions match the incoming stimuli, the model is able to learn the structure and statistics of its temporal inputs and produces responses of neurons resembling those in the brain. The model may help in further understanding neural circuits in sensory cortical areas.Competing Interest StatementBM and RB are shareholders in Neu Edge Ltd, which designs AI accelerator hardware.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel method to implicitly encode Successor Representations (SRs) using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). SRs are a method to encode states of the environment in terms of their predictive relationships with other states, which can be used to predict long-term future rewards. In standard explicit methods, the value of SR is found from an explicit map between future states after an action or to find an approximate function. Instead, our method encodes SR implicitly using a GAN. The distribution of samples generated by the GAN system approximates the successor representation. We also suggest an action decision procedure for the implicit encoding of SR. The system makes the decision using an analysis-by-synthesis procedure that it attempts to synthesize a sample that can explain the action decision constraints of the current and target states. Our system is different from the classical SR in several points. It can sample actual samples reflecting SR distribution, which is not easy for explicit models. It can also get around the issue of explicitly representing probabilities or successor representation values and doing math over them. We tested our system in a toy environment, where the agent could learn the implicit successor representation successfully and use it for action decisions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that the brain employs probabilistic generative models to optimally interpret sensory information. This hypothesis has been formalised in distinct frameworks, focusing on explaining separate phenomena. On one hand, predictive coding theory proposed how the probabilistic models can be learned by networks of neurons employing local synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, neural sampling theories have demonstrated how stochastic dynamics enable neural circuits to represent the posterior distributions of latent states of the environment. Here, we bring together these two lines of theoretic work by introducing Monte Carlo predictive coding (MCPC). We demonstrate that the integration of predictive coding with neural sampling results in a neural network that learns precise generative models using local computation and plasticity. The neural dynamics of MCPC infer the posterior distributions of the latent states in the presence of sensory inputs, and can generate likely inputs in their absence. Furthermore, MCPC captures the experimental observations on the variability of neural activity during perceptual tasks. By combining predictive coding and neural sampling, MCPC offers a unifying theory of cortical computation which can account for both sets of neural data that previously had been explained by these individual frameworks.Competing Interest StatementR.B. is a shareholder in Fractile, Ltd., which designs artificial intelligence accelerator hardware.

	abstract = {In this study, we develop a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) model of pre-frontal cortex that predicts sensory inputs, actions, and outcomes at the next time step. Synaptic weights in the model are adjusted to minimize sequence prediction error, adapting a deep learning rule similar to those of large language models. The model, called Sequence Prediction Error Learning (SPEL), is a simple RNN that predicts world state at the next time step, but that differs from standard RNNs by using its own prediction errors from the previous state predictions as inputs to the hidden units of the network. We show that the time course of sequence prediction errors generated by the model closely matched the activity time courses of populations of neurons in macaque prefrontal cortex. Hidden units in the model responded to combinations of task variables and exhibited sensitivity to changing stimulus probability in ways that closely resembled monkey prefrontal neurons. Moreover, the model generated prolonged response times to infrequent, unexpected events as did monkeys. The results suggest that prefrontal cortex may generate internal models of the temporal structure of the world even during tasks that do not explicitly depend on temporal expectation, using a sequence prediction error minimization learning rule to do so. As such, the SPEL model provides a unified, general-purpose theoretical framework for modeling the lateral prefrontal cortex.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Coordinating with others is part of our everyday experience. Previous studies using sensorimotor coordination games suggest that human dyads develop coordination strategies that can be interpreted as Nash equilibria. However, if the players are uncertain about what their partner is doing, they develop coordination strategies which are robust to the actual partner{\textquoteright}s actions. This has suggested that humans select their actions based on an explicit prediction of what the partner will be doing {\textendash} a partner model {\textendash} which is probabilistic by nature. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of a joint coordination over repeated trials remain unknown. Very much like sensorimotor adaptation of individuals to external perturbations (eg force fields or visual rotations), dynamical models may help to understand how joint coordination develops over repeated trials.Here we present a general computational model {\textendash} based on game theory and Bayesian estimation {\textendash} designed to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of a joint coordination over repeated trials. Joint tasks are modeled as quadratic games, where each participant{\textquoteright}s task is expressed as a quadratic cost function. Each participant predicts their partner{\textquoteright}s next move (partner model) by optimally combining predictions and sensory observations, and selects their actions through a stochastic optimization of its expected cost, given the partner model. The model parameters include perceptual uncertainty (sensory noise), partner representation (retention rate and process noise), uncertainty in action selection and its rate of decay (which can be interpreted as the action{\textquoteright}s learning rate). The model can be used in two ways: (i) to simulate interactive behaviors, thus helping to make specific predictions in the context of a given joint action scenario; and (ii) to analyze the action time series in actual experiments, thus providing quantitative metrics that describe individual behaviors during an actual joint action.We demonstrate the model in a variety of joint action scenarios. In a sensorimotor version of the Stag Hunt game, the model predicts that different representations of the partner lead to different Nash equilibria. In a joint two via-point (2-VP) reaching task, in which the actions consist of complex trajectories, the model captures well the observed temporal evolution of performance. For this task we also estimated the model parameters from experimental observations, which provided a comprehensive characterization of individual dyad participants.Computational models of joint action may help identifying the factors preventing or facilitating the development of coordination. They can be used in clinical settings, to interpret the observed behaviors in individuals with impaired interaction capabilities. They may also provide a theoretical basis to devise artificial agents that establish forms of coordination that facilitate neuromotor recovery.Author summary Acting together (joint action) is part of everyday experience. But, how do we learn to coordinate with others and collaborate? Using a combination of experiments and computational models we show that through multiple repetitions of the same joint task we select the action which represents the {\textquoteleft}best response{\textquoteright} to what we believe our opponent will do. Such a belief about our partner (partner model) is developed gradually, by optimally combining prior assumptions (how repeatable or how erratic our opponent behaves) with sensory information about our opponent{\textquoteright}s past actions. Rooted in game theory and Bayesian estimation, the model accounts for the development of the mutual {\textquoteleft}trust{\textquoteright} among partners which is essential for establishing a mutually advantageous collaboration, and explains how we combine decisions and movements in complex coordination scenarios. The model can be used as a generative tool, to simulate the development of coordination in a specific joint action scenario, and as an analytic tool to characterize the individual traits or defects in the ability to establish collaborations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

As a hallmark of human endocrine activity, the cortisol awakening response (CAR) is recognized to play a critical role in modulating emotional and executive functions. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of such effects remain elusive. By leveraging pharmacological neuroimaging technique and Hidden Markov Modeling of brain state dynamics, we show that the CAR proactively modulates rapid reconfigurations (state) of large-scale brain networks across multi-task demands. Behaviorally, suppression of CAR proactively and selectively impaired accuracy for emotional discrimination task but not for working memory (WM). In parallel, suppressed CAR led to a decrease in the occurrence rate of brain state dominant to emotional processing, but an increase in brain state linking to executive control under high WM demand. Further energy-based analyses revealed an increase in transition frequency and sequence complexity along with an increased entropy during emotional tasks when suppressed CAR, suggesting a decreased energy supply. Moreover, an increased transition frequency was observed when shifting from neutral to emotional conditions, but an opposite pattern during WM task, with n decreased transition frequency shifts from low to high-executive demands. Our findings establish a causal link between CAR and dynamic allocation of neural resources for emotional and executive functions, suggesting a cognitive neuroendocrine account for CAR-mediated proactive effects and human allostasis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the essential role of interoception in healthy emotional processing and the pathology of major depressive disorder. However, it is unclear how individual differences in healthy people with high depression risk (HDR; i.e., individual differences in depression risk) are related to the neurophysiological underpinnings of interoception and emotional reactions under different degrees of certainty. We examined whether an individual{\textquoteright}s depression risk mediates the relationships of heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), a neurophysiological marker of cardiac interoception, with heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), indices for cardiac reactivity. In a concurrent electroencephalogram-electrocardiogram (EEG-ECG) experiment, 26 healthy participants completed an emotion-evoking picture-evaluation task. Each trial began with a differential auditory cue that was associated with the certainty of subsequently seeing a pleasant or unpleasant picture. The results showed the following: after participants saw a cue of uncertainty, HDR was associated with 1) reduced neural activity when anticipating upcoming pictures and 2) enhanced physiological reactions to unexpected, unpleasant pictures. These results suggest that weaker predictions and augmented prediction errors for negative emotional stimuli reflect depression risk. Moreover, depression risk significantly mediated the relationships between HEPs and HR and between HEPs and HRV for unexpected, unpleasant stimuli. This study provides evidence that interoception and autonomic cardiac regulation may be altered by depression risk. This highlights the insights provided by specific indices of brain{\textendash}heart interactions, such as HEPs, into the underlying activity of the autonomic nervous system and unique interoceptive disturbances associated with depression risk.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we present evidence delineating the constraints of current fMRI activation models in capturing naturalistic fear dynamics. To address this challenge, we fuse naturalistic fMRI with predictive modeling techniques to develop an ecologically valid fear signature that integrates activation and connectivity profiles, allowing for accurate prediction of subjective fear experience under highly dynamic close-to-real-life conditions. This signature arises from insights into the crucial role of distributed brain networks and their interactions in emotion modulation, and the potential of network-level information to improve predictions in dynamic contexts. Across a series of investigations, we demonstrate that this signature predicts stable and dynamic fear experiences across naturalistic scenarios with heightened sensitivity and specificity, surpassing traditional activation{\textendash} and connectivity-based signatures. Notably, the integration of affective connectivity profiles enables accurate real-time predictions of fear fluctuations in naturalistic settings. Additionally, we unearth a distributed yet redundant brain-wide representation of fear experiences. Subjective fear is encoded not only by distributed cortical and subcortical regions but also by their interactions, with no single brain system conveying substantial unique information. Our study establishes a comprehensive and ecologically valid functional brain architecture for subjective fear in dynamic environments and bridges the gap between experimental neuroscience and real-life emotional experience.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

SoA is typically measured by collecting participants{\textquoteright} subjective judgments, conflating both implicit and explicit processing. Consequently, the interplay between implicit sensorimotor processing and explicit agency judgments is not well understood. Here, we evaluated in one exploratory and one preregistered experiment (N=60), using a machine learning approach, the relation between a well-known mechanism of implicit sensorimotor adaptation and explicit SoA judgments. Specifically, we examined whether subjective judgments of SoA and sensorimotor conflicts could be inferred from hand kinematics in a sensorimotor task using a virtual hand (VH). In both experiments participants performed a hand movement and viewed a virtual hand making a movement that could either be synchronous with their action or include a parametric temporal delay. After each movement, participants judged whether their actual movement was congruent with the movement they observed. Our results demonstrated that sensorimotor conflicts could be inferred from implicit motor kinematics on a trial by trial basis. Moreover, detection of sensorimotor conflicts from machine learning models of kinematic data provided more accurate classification of sensorimotor congruence than participants{\textquoteright} explicit judgments. These results were replicated in a second, preregistered, experiment. These findings show evidence of diverging implicit and explicit processing for SoA and suggest that the brain holds high-quality information on sensorimotor conflicts that is not fully utilized in the inference of conscious agency.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Efficient sensory detection requires the capacity to ignore task-irrelevant information, for example when optic flow patterns created by egomotion need to be disentangled from object perception. To investigate how this is achieved in the visual system, predictive coding with sensorimotor mismatch detection is an attractive starting point. Indeed, experimental evidence for sensorimotor mismatch signals in early visual areas exists, but it is not understood how they are integrated into cortical networks that perform input segmentation and categorization. Our model advances a biologically plausible solution by extending predictive coding models with the ability to distinguish self-generated from externally caused optic flow. We first show that a simple three neuron circuit produces experience-dependent sensorimotor mismatch responses, in agreement with calcium imaging data from mice. This microcircuit is then integrated into a neural network with two generative streams. The motor-to-visual stream consists of parallel microcircuits between motor and visual areas and learns to spatially predict optic flow resulting from self-motion. The second stream bidirectionally connects a motion-selective higher visual area (mHVA) to V1, assigning a crucial role to the abundant feedback connections: the maintenance of a generative model of externally caused optic flow. In the model, area mHVA learns to segment moving objects from the background, and facilitates object categorization. Based on shared neurocomputational principles across species, the model also maps onto primate vision. Our work extends the Hebbian predictive coding to sensorimotor settings, in which the agent actively moves - and learns to predict the consequences of its own movements.Significance statement This research addresses a fundamental challenge in sensory perception: how the brain distinguishes between self-generated and externally caused visual motion. Using a computational model inspired by predictive coding and sensorimotor mismatch detection, the study proposes a biologically plausible solution. The model incorporates a neural microcircuit that generates sensorimotor mismatch responses, aligning with experimental data from mice. This microcircuit is integrated into a neural network with two streams: one predicting self-motion-induced optic flow and another maintaining a generative model for externally caused optic flow. The research advances our understanding of how the brain segments visual input into object and background, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying perception and categorization not only in rodents, but also in primates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Meaningful variation in internal states that impacts cognition and behavior remains challenging to discover and characterize. Here we leveraged trial-to-trial fluctuations in the brain-wide signal recorded using functional MRI to test if distinct sets of brain regions are activated on different trials when accomplishing the same task. Across three different perceptual decision-making experiments, we estimated the brain activations for each trial. We then clustered the trials based on their similarity using modularity-maximization, a data-driven classification method. In each experiment, we found multiple distinct but stable subtypes of trials, suggesting that the same task can be accomplished in the presence of widely varying brain activation patterns. Surprisingly, in all experiments, one of the subtypes exhibited strong activation in the default mode network, which is typically thought to decrease in activity during tasks that require externally focused attention. The remaining subtypes were characterized by activations in different task-positive areas. The default mode network subtype was characterized by behavioral signatures that were similar to the other subtypes exhibiting activation with task-positive regions. Finally, in a fourth experiment, we tested whether multiple activation patterns would also appear for a qualitatively different, working memory task. We again found multiple subtypes of trials with differential activation in frontoparietal control, dorsal attention, and ventral attention networks. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the same cognitive tasks are accomplished through multiple brain activation patterns.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {One of the most fundamental laws of physics is the principle of least action. Motivated by its predictive power, we introduce a neuronal least-action principle for cortical processing of sensory streams to produce appropriate behavioural outputs in real time. The principle postulates that the voltage dynamics of cortical pyramidal neurons prospectively minimize the local somato-dendritic mismatch error within individual neurons. For motor output neurons, it implies minimizing an instantaneous behavioural error. For deep network neurons, it implies a prospective firing to overcome integration delays and correct for possible output errors right in time. The neuron-specific errors are extracted in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons through a cortical microcircuit that tries to explain away the feedback from the periphery, and correct the trajectory on the fly. Any motor output is in a moving equilibrium with the sensory inputs and the motor feedback during the whole sensory-motor trajectory. Ongoing synaptic plasticity reduces the somato-dendritic mismatch error within each cortical neuron and performs gradient descent on the output cost at any moment in time. The neuronal least-action principle offers an axiomatic framework to derive local neuronal and synaptic dynamics for global real-time computation and learning in the brain and in physical substrates in general.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Do early effects of predictability in visual word recognition reflect prediction error? Electrophysiological research investigating word processing has demonstrated predictability effects in the N1, or first negative component of the event-related potential (ERP). However, findings regarding the magnitude of effects and potential interactions of predictability with lexical variables have been inconsistent. Moreover, past studies have typically used categorical designs with relatively small samples and relied on by-participant analyses. Nevertheless, reports have generally shown that predicted words elicit less negative-going (i.e., lower amplitude) N1s, a pattern consistent with a simple predictive coding account. In our preregistered study, we tested this account via the interaction between prediction magnitude and certainty. A picture-word verification paradigm was implemented in which pictures were followed by tightly matched picture-congruent or picture-incongruent written nouns. The predictability of target (picture-congruent) nouns was manipulated continuously based on norms of association between a picture and its name. ERPs from 68 participants revealed a pattern of effects opposite to that expected under a simple predictive coding framework.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Background Efficient information sampling is crucial for human inference and decision-making, even for young children. Information sampling is also closely associated with the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), since both the social interaction difficulties and repetitive behaviors suggest that autistic people may sample information from the environment distinctively. Previous research on information sampling in ASD focused mainly on adolescents and adults, and on whether they over- or under-sample. The specific ways in which autistic children sample information, especially when facing explicit costs and adapting to environmental changes, remain unclear.Methods We employed an adapted bead task to investigate the sampling behavior of 24 autistic and 41 neurotypical children, matched for age and IQ. In each trial of our experiment, children gathered information about an unknown target isle by drawing samples from it and then guessed the target between two isles based on their samples. In conditions where sampling was costly, children needed to weigh the benefits of information against the costs of acquiring additional samples. Through computational modeling and intricate behavioral measures, we revealed how the two groups of children differed in sampling decisions and underlying cognitive mechanisms.Results Under conditions involving costs, autistic children showed less efficient sampling than their neurotypical peers. This inefficiency was due to their increased variability in the number of samples taken across trials rather than a systematic bias. Computational models indicated that while both groups shared a similar decision process, autistic children{\textquoteright}s sampling decisions were less influenced by dynamic changes and more driven by recent evidence, thus leading to their increased sampling variation and reduced efficiency.Limitations To refine ASD subtyping and correlate symptom severity with behavioral characteristics and computational findings, future research may need larger participant groups and more comprehensive clinical assessments.Conclusions This study reveals an inefficiency of autistic children in information sampling and tracks down this inefficiency to their increased sampling variability, primarily due to their cognitive preference for more local and static information. These findings are consistent with several influential behavioral theories of ASD and highlight the needs of a multi-level understanding of cognitive flexibility in ASD.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The process of making inference on networks of spiking neurons is crucial to decipher the underlying mechanisms of neural computation. Mean-field theory simplifies the interactions between neurons to produce macroscopic network behavior, facilitating the study of information processing and computation within the brain. In this study, we perform inference on a mean-field model of spiking neurons to gain insight into likely parameter values, uniqueness and degeneracies, and also to explore how well the statistical relationship between parameters is maintained by traversing across scales. We benchmark against state-of-the-art optimization and Bayesian estimation algorithms to identify their strengths and weaknesses in our analysis. We show that when confronted with dynamical noise or in the case of missing data in the presence of bistability, generating probability distributions using deep neural density estimators outperforms other algorithms, such as adaptive Monte Carlo sampling. However, this class of deep generative models may result in an overestimation of uncertainty and correlation between parameters. Nevertheless, this issue can be improved by incorporating time-delay embedding. Moreover, we show that training deep Neural ODEs on spiking neurons enables the inference of system dynamics from microscopic states. In summary, this work demonstrates the enhanced accuracy and efficiency of inference on networks of spiking neurons when deep learning is harnessed to solve inverse problems in neural computation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.MFMean-FieldQIFQuadratic Integrate-and-FireSBISimulation-Based InferenceSNPESequential Neural Posterior EstimationMCMCMarkov Chain Monte CarloHMCHamiltonian Monte CarloMAPMaximum a PosterioriDEDifferential EvolutionPSOParticle Swarm OptimizationBOBayesian OptimizationODEsOrdinary Differential EquationsSDEsStochastic Differential EquationsNeural ODEsNeural Ordinary Differential Equations},

However, recent evidence indicates that deviations from emotion expectations, termed affective PEs, play a crucial role in shaping behavior. Whether there is neural separability between emotion and reward signals remains unknown.

Behavioral results reveal that while affective PEs predict choices when little is known about how a partner will behave, reward PEs become more predictive overtime as uncertainty about a partner{\textquoteright}s behavior diminishes. This functional dissociation is mirrored neurally by engagement of distinct event-related potentials. The FRN indexes reward PEs while the P3b tracks affective PEs.

	abstract = {Mindfulness meditation involves training attention, commonly towards the current sensory experience, with an attitude of non-judgemental awareness. Theoretical perspectives suggest meditation alters the brain{\textquoteright}s predictive processing mechanisms, increasing the synaptic gain and precision with which sensory information is processed, and reducing the generation or elaboration of higher-order beliefs. Recent research suggests that forwards and backwards travelling cortical alpha waves provide an indication of these predictive processing functions. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to test whether the strength of forwards and backwards travelling cortical alpha waves differed between experienced meditators and a matched sample of non-meditators, both during an eyes-closed resting state (N = 97) and during a visual cognitive (Go/No-go) task (N = 126). Our results showed that meditators produced stronger forwards travelling cortical alpha waves compared to non-meditators, both while resting with their eyes closed and during task performance. Meditators also exhibited weaker backwards travelling cortical alpha wave strength while resting with their eyes closed. These results may be indicative of a neural mechanism underpinning enhanced attention associated with meditation practice, as well as a potential neural marker of the reductions in resting mind-wandering that are suggested to be associated with meditation practice. The results also support models of brain function that suggest attention modification can be achieved by mental training aimed at increased processing of sensory information, which might be indexed by greater strength of forwards travelling cortical alpha waves.Competing Interest StatementIn the last 3 years PBF has received equipment for research from Neurosoft and Nexstim.

While most existing works have taken a hand-wiring approach to creating microcircuits that match experimental results, recent work in applying an optimisation approach to rate-based artificial neural networks revealed that cortical connectivity might result from self-organisation given some fundamental computational principle, such as energy efficiency. As no corresponding approach has studied this in more plausible networks of spiking neurons, we here investigate whether predictive coding properties in a multi-compartment spiking neural network can emerge from energy optimisation. We find that a model trained with an energy objective in addition to a task-relevant objective is able to reconstruct internal representations given top-down expectation signals alone. Additionally, neurons in the energy-optimised model also show differential responses to expected versus unexpected stimuli, qualitatively similar to experimental evidence for predictive coding. These findings indicate that predictive-coding-like behaviour might be an emergent property of energy optimisation, providing a new perspective on how predictive coding could be achieved in the cortex.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

As such, continued elucidation of the similarities and differences between sexes is necessary in order to gain insight into brain function and vulnerability. The connection between the hippocampus (Hipp) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a crucial site where modulation of neuronal activity mediates reward-related behavior. Our previous work demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) of Hipp-NAc synapses is rewarding, and that mice can make learned associations between LTP of these synapses and the contextual environment in which LTP occurred. Here, we investigate sex differences in the mechanisms underlying Hipp-NAc LTP using whole-cell electrophysiology and pharmacology. We found that males and females display similar magnitudes of Hipp-NAc LTP which occurs postsynaptically. However, LTP in females requires L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) for postsynaptic Ca2+ influx, while males rely on NMDA receptors (NMDAR). Additionally, females require estrogen receptor α (ERα) activity for LTP while males do not. These differential mechanisms converge as LTP in both sexes depends on CAMKII activity and occurs independently of dopamine-1 receptor (D1R) activation. Our results have elucidated sex-specific molecular mechanisms for LTP in an integral excitatory pathway that mediates reward-related behaviors, emphasizing the importance of considering sex as a variable in mechanistic studies. Continued characterization of sex-specific mechanisms underlying plasticity will offer novel insight into the neurophysiological basis of behavior, with significant implications for understanding how diverse processes mediate behavior and contribute to vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Strengthening of Hipp-NAc synapses drives reward-related behaviors. Male and female mice have similar magnitudes of long-term potentiation (LTP) and both sexes have a predicted postsynaptic locus of plasticity. Despite these similarities, we illustrate here that sex-specific molecular mechanisms are used to elicit LTP. Given the bidirectional relationship between Hipp-NAc synaptic strength in mediating reward-related behaviors, the use of distinct molecular mechanisms may explain sex differences observed in stress susceptibility or response to rewarding stimuli. Discovery and characterization of convergent sex differences provides mechanistic insight into the sex-specific function of Hipp-NAc circuitry and has widespread implications for circuits mediating learning and reward-related behavior.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The fact that objects without proper support will fall to the ground is not only a natural phenomenon, but also common sense in mind. Previous studies suggest that humans may infer objects{\textquoteright} stability through a world model that performs mental simulations with a priori knowledge of gravity acting upon the objects. Here we measured participants{\textquoteright} sensitivity to gravity to investigate how the world model works. We found that the world model on gravity was not a faithful replica of the physical laws, but instead encoded gravity{\textquoteright}s vertical direction as a Gaussian distribution. The world model with this stochastic feature fit nicely with participants{\textquoteright} subjective sense of objects{\textquoteright} stability and explained the illusion that taller objects are perceived as more likely to fall. Furthermore, a computational model with reinforcement learning revealed that the stochastic characteristic likely originated from experience-dependent comparisons between predictions formed by internal simulations and the realities observed in the external world, which illustrated the ecological advantage of stochastic representation in balancing accuracy and speed for efficient stability inference. The stochastic world model on gravity provides an example of how a priori knowledge of the physical world is implemented in mind that helps humans operate flexibly in open-ended environments.Significance Statement Humans possess an exceptional capacity for inferring the stability of objects, a skill that has been crucial to the survival of our predecessors and continues to facilitate our daily interactions with the natural world. The present study elucidates that our representation of gravitational direction adheres to a Gaussian distribution, with the vertical orientation as the maximum likelihood. This stochastic representation is likely to have originated from our interactions with the physical world, conferring an ecological advantage of balancing accuracy with speed. Therefore, the world model on gravity in the mind is a distorted replica of the natural world, enabling adaptive functionality in open-ended environments and thus shedding light on developing machines imbued with embodied intelligence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {How we move our bodies affects how we perceive sound. For instance, we can explore an environment to seek out the source of a sound and we can use head movements to compensate for hearing loss. How we do this is not well understood because many auditory experiments are designed to limit head and body movements. To study the role of movement in hearing, we developed a behavioral task called sound-seeking that rewarded mice for tracking down an ongoing sound source. Over the course of learning, mice more efficiently navigated to the sound. We then asked how auditory behavior was affected by hearing loss induced by surgical removal of the malleus from the middle ear. An innate behavior, the auditory startle response, was abolished by bilateral hearing loss and unaffected by unilateral hearing loss. Similarly, performance on the sound-seeking task drastically declined after bilateral hearing loss and did not recover. In striking contrast, mice with unilateral hearing loss were only transiently impaired on sound-seeking; over a recovery period of about a week, they regained high levels of performance, increasingly reliant on a different spatial sampling strategy. Thus, even in the face of permanent unilateral damage to the peripheral auditory system, mice recover their ability to perform a naturalistic sound-seeking task. This paradigm provides an opportunity to examine how body movement enables better hearing and resilient adaptation to sensory deprivation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Increased emotional arousal (EA) has been related to lower high- frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), lower EEG parieto-occipital alpha power, and higher heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes. We studied EA-related brain-heart interactions (BHIs) using immersive virtual reality (VR) for naturalistic yet controlled emotion induction. 29 healthy adults (13 women, age: 26{\textpm}3) completed a VR experience that included rollercoasters while EEG and ECG were recorded. Continuous EA ratings were collected during a video replay immediately after. We analyzed EA-related changes in HF-HRV as well as in BHIs using HEPs and directional functional BHI modeling.Higher EA was associated with lower HEP amplitudes in a left fronto-central electrode cluster. While parasympathetic modulation of the heart (HF-HRV) and parieto-occipital EEG alpha power were reduced during higher EA, there was no evidence for the hypothesized EA-related changes in bidirectional information flow between them. Whole-brain exploratory analyses in additional EEG (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) and HRV (low-frequency, LF, and HF) frequency bands indicated a temporo-occipital cluster, in which higher EA was linked to decreased brain-to-heart (gamma{\textrightarrow}HF-HRV) and increased heart-to-brain (LF-HRV{\textrightarrow}gamma) information flow. Our results confirm previous findings from less naturalistic experiments and suggest EA-related BHI changes in temporo-occipital gamma power.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

High-level cognitive processes can find the best sequence of actions to achieve goals in uncertain environments, but they are slow and require significant computational demand. Contrarily, lower-level processing allows reacting to environmental stimuli rapidly, but with limited capacity to determine optimal actions. Through reiteration of the same task, biological organisms find the optimal tradeoff: from primitive movements, composite actions gradually emerge by creating task-specific neural structures. The two frameworks of a recent theory called {\textquotedblleft}active inference{\textquotedblright} can capture high-level and low-level processes of human behavior, but how task specialization may occur in there terms is still unclear. Here, we compare two hierarchical strategies on a pick-and-place task: a discrete-continuous model with planning capabilities and a continuous-only model with fixed transitions. We analyze several consequences of defining movements in intrinsic and extrinsic domains. Finally, we propose how discrete actions might be encoded into continuous representations, comparing them with different motor learning phases and laying the foundations for further studies on bio-inspired task adaptation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Background A critical advance in depression research is to clarify the hypothesized role of interoceptive processing in neural mechanisms of treatment efficacy. This study tests whether cortical interoceptive processing, as indexed by the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP), is modulated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) for treatment resistant depression (TRD).Methods Eight patients with TRD were enrolled in a study of SCC DBS safety and efficacy. Electroencephalography (EEG) and symptom severity measures were sampled in a laboratory setting over the course of a six-month treatment protocol. The primary outcome measure was an EEG-derived HEP, which reflects cortical processing of heartbeat sensation. Cluster-based permutation analyses were used to test the effect of stimulation and time in treatment on the HEP. The change in signal magnitude after treatment was correlated with change in depression severity as measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.Results HEP amplitude was greater after 24 weeks of treatment (t(7)=-4.40, p=.003, g=-1.38, 95\% Cl [-2.3, -0.42]), and this change was inversely correlated with latency of treatment response (rho = -0.75, 95\% Cl [-0.95, -0.11], p=.03). An acute effect of DBS was also observed, but as a decrease in HEP amplitude (t(6) =6.66, p\&lt;.001, g=2.19, 95\% Cl [0.81, 3.54]). HEP differences were most pronounced over left posterior sensors from 405-425 ms post-stimulus.Conclusion Brain-based evidence substantiates a theorized link between interoception and depression, and suggests an interoceptive contribution to the mechanism of treatment efficacy with deep brain stimulation for severe depression.Competing Interest StatementDr. Choi is a consultant to Abbott Laboratories.

	abstract = {We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the neocortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using prediction errors. As a result, lower levels form representations that encode sequences at shorter timescales (e.g., a single step) while higher levels form representations that encode sequences at longer timescales (e.g., an entire sequence). We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation creates low-dimensional combinations of a set of learned temporal dynamics to explain input sequences. When trained on natural videos, the lower-level model neurons developed spacetime receptive fields similar to those of simple cells in the primary visual cortex while the higher-level responses spanned longer timescales, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. Additionally, the network{\textquoteright}s hierarchical sequence representation exhibited both predictive and postdictive effects resembling those observed in visual motion processing in humans (e.g., in the flash-lag illusion). When coupled with an associative memory emulating the role of the hippocampus, the model allowed episodic memories to be stored and retrieved, supporting cue-triggered recall of an input sequence similar to activity recall in the visual cortex. When extended to three hierarchical levels, the model learned progressively more abstract temporal representations along the hierarchy. Taken together, our results suggest that cortical processing and learning of sequences can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical spatiotemporal generative model of the visual world.Author Summary The brain is adept at predicting stimuli and events at multiple timescales. How do the neuronal networks in the brain achieve this remarkable capability? We propose that the neocortex employs dynamic predictive coding to learn hierarchical spatiotemporal representations. Using computer simulations, we show that when exposed to natural videos, a hierarchical neural network that minimizes prediction errors develops stable and longer timescale responses at the higher level; lower-level neurons learn space-time receptive fields similar to the receptive fields of primary visual cortical cells. The same network also exhibits several effects in visual motion processing and supports cue-triggered activity recall. Our results provide a new framework for understanding the genesis of temporal response hierarchies and activity recall in the neocortex.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In a task that tests behavioral flexibility in rodents, LC-NE activity correlated with task acuity and altered depending on trial outcome. Silencing LC neurons caused perseverative behavior and impeded cognitive remapping in OFC, while enhancing LC activity disrupted the ability of new maps to stabilize.

Despite their separate origin, they interact with reward processing systems that respond to external stimuli. This paper aims to illuminate the functioning of the needing system through the lens of active inference, a framework for understanding brain and cognition.We propose that need states exert a pervasive influence on the organism, which in active inference terms translates to a {\textquotedblleft}pervasive surprise{\textquotedblright} - a measure of the distance from the organism{\textquoteright}s preferred state. Crucially, we define needing as an active inference process that seeks to reduce this pervasive surprise.Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that our proposal successfully captures key aspects of the phenomenology and neurobiology of needing. We show that as need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states strengthens, independently of external reward prediction. Furthermore, need states increase the precision of states (stimuli and actions) leading to preferred states, suggesting their ability to amplify the value of reward cues and rewards themselves.Collectively, our model and simulations provide valuable insights into the directional and underlying influence of need states, revealing how this influence amplifies the wanting or liking associated with relevant stimuli.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Prior research has highlighted the link between interbrain synchrony and positive outcomes in human social interaction.Neurofeedback is an established method to train one{\textquoteright}s brain activity and might offer a possibility to increase interbrain synchrony. Consequently, it would be advantageous to determine the feasibility of creating a neurofeedback system for enhancing interbrain synchrony to benefit human interaction.In this study, we investigated whether the most widely employed metric for interbrain synchrony, namely wavelet transform coherence, can be assessed accurately in near real-time using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which is recognized for its mobility and ecological suitability for interactive research. To this end, we have undertaken a comprehensive approach encompassing simulations and a re-evaluation of two human-interaction datasets. Our findings indicate the potential for a stable near real-time measurement of wavelet transform coherence for integration durations of about one minute. This would align well with the methodology of an intermittent neurofeedback procedure.Our investigation lays the technical foundation for an fNIRS-based system to measure interbrain synchrony in near real-time.

	abstract = {Human listeners possess an innate capacity to discern patterns within rapidly evolving auditory sequences. Core questions, at the forefront of ongoing research, focus on the mechanisms through which these representations are acquired and whether the brain prioritizes or suppresses predictable sensory signals.Previous work, using fast sequences (tone-pips presented at a rate of 20Hz), revealed sustained response effects that appear to track the dynamic predictability of the sequence. Here we extend the investigation to slower sequences (4Hz), permitting the isolation of responses to individual tones. Stimuli were 50ms tone-pips, ordered into random (RND) and regular (REG; a repeating pattern of 10 frequencies) sequences; Two timing profiles were created: in {\textquoteleft}fast{\textquoteright} sequences tone-pips were presented in direct succession (20 Hz); in {\textquoteleft}slow{\textquoteright} sequences tone-pips were separated by a 200ms silent gap (4 Hz).Naive participants (N=22; both sexes) passively listened to these sequences, while brain responses were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results unveiled a heightened magnitude of sustained brain responses in REG when compared to RND patterns. This manifested from three tones after the onset of the pattern repetition, even in the context of slower sequences characterized by extended pattern durations (2500ms). This observation underscores the remarkable implicit sensitivity of the auditory brain to acoustic regularities. Importantly, brain responses evoked by single tones exhibited the opposite pattern - stronger responses to tones in RND compared to REG sequences. The demonstration of simultaneous but opposing sustained and evoked response effects reveals concurrent processes that shape the representation of unfolding auditory patterns.Significance Statement Humans excel at detecting predictable patterns within sound sequences, a process crucial for listening, language processing, and music appreciation. However, questions persist about the underlying neural mechanisms and the specific information monitored by the brain.Our study addresses these questions by analysing magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from participants exposed to predictable and unpredictable tone-pip patterns. We found that the MEG signal simultaneously captures two crucial aspects of predictability tracking.Firstly, sustained MEG activity, tracking the sequence{\textquoteright}s evolution, dynamically assesses pattern predictability, shedding light on how the brain evaluates reliability. Secondly, phasic MEG activity, reflecting responses to individual events, shows reduced activity to predictable tones, aligning with the idea that the brain efficiently encodes and anticipates upcoming events in predictable contexts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we addressed these questions by recording the activity of layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons in the motor cortex using two-photon calcium imaging in head-restrained mice, while they reached for water droplets presented at different spatial locations around their snout. Our results reveal that a majority (\&gt;80\%) of L2/3 neurons with task-related activity are target-space selective and their activity is contingent on a single target position in an ego-centric reference frame. This spatial framework is preferentially organized along three cardinal directions (Center, Left and Right). Surprisingly, the coding of target space is not limited to the activity during movement planning or execution, but is also predominant during preceding and subsequent phases of the task, and even persists beyond water consumption. More importantly, target specificity is independent of the movement kinematics and is immediately updated when the target is moved to a new position. Our findings suggest that, rather than descending motor commands, the ensemble of L2/3 neurons in the motor cortex conjointly encode internal (behavioral) and external (spatial) aspects of the task, playing a role in higher-order representations related to estimation processes of the ongoing actions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {While the sensorimotor cortices are central neural substrates for motor control and learning, how the interaction between their subregions with visual cortices contributes to acquiring de novo visuomotor skills is poorly understood. We designed a continuous visuomotor task in fMRI where participants learned an arbitrary visuomotor mapping. To dissociate motor and somatosensory cortices functions, we manipulated visual feedback of a cursor such that they learned to control using fingers under two alternating conditions: online cursor feedback is available or unavailable except when a target is reached. We found double dissociation of fMRI activity in subregions of the sensorimotor and visual cortices and their interaction, which were mediated by the visual feedback. We also found a significant reduction in functional connectivity between somatosensory cortices and early visual cortices, which was highly correlated with performance improvement. These findings support the distinct interaction between subregions of sensorimotor cortices and visual cortices while highlighting the more dominant role of somatosensory cortices over motor cortices during de novo motor learning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Prediction and memory are strongly intertwined, with predictions relying on memory retrieval, whilst also influencing memory encoding. However, it is unclear how prediction errors during learning, as measured by the N400 event-related potential (ERP), influence explicit memory performance, and how individual neural factors may modulate this relationship. The current study sought to investigate the effect of prediction and individual neural variability on memory processing, whilst exploring the N400 as a prediction error signal in a context extending beyond language. Participants (N = 48, females = 33) completed a study-test paradigm where they first viewed predictable and unpredictable four-item {\textquoteleft}ABCD{\textquoteright} sequences of outdoor scene images, whilst their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Subsequently, their memory for the images was tested, and N400 patterns during learning were compared with memory outcomes. Strikingly, greater N400 amplitudes during learning were associated with enhanced memory at test for individuals with low versus high individual alpha frequencies (IAFs). This indicates that IAF may influence stimulus precision weightings and the extent to which prediction errors drive memory encoding. Memory was also strongest for predictable images in the {\textquoteleft}B{\textquoteright} position, suggesting that when processing longer sequences, the brain may prioritise the data deemed most informative for predictive model updating. Ultimately, the results provide novel insight into the effect of prediction on memory, by highlighting the role of inter-subject variability, whilst shedding light on the accumulation of predictions across sequences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a governing role in regulating cellular signaling, fine-tuning protein function, and orchestrating complex biological processes. Despite their importance, the lack of comprehensive tools for studying PTMs from a pathway-centric perspective has limited our ability to understand how PTMs modulate cellular pathways on a molecular level. Here, we present PTMNavigator, a tool integrated into the ProteomicsDB platform, which offers an interactive interface for researchers to overlay experimental PTM data on top of \~{}3000 well-curated pathway diagrams. This offers a comprehensive view of the intricate relationship between PTMs and signaling pathways. To demonstrate the utility of PTMNavigator, we applied it to two phosphoproteomics perturbation datasets. First, PTMNavigator enhanced pathway enrichment analysis by showing how the regulated peptides are distributed in the pathways with high enrichment scores. Second, it visualized how drug treatments result in a discernable flow of PTM-driven signaling within pathways. Third, PTMNavigator aided in extending existing pathways by uncovering previously unknown relationships between PTMs and pathway components. By facilitating the discovery of novel PTM-pathway interactions and enhancing our understanding of cellular signaling dynamics, PTMNavigator advances our knowledge of PTM biology and its implications in health and disease.Competing Interest StatementBK and MW are founders and shareholders of OmicScouts and MSAID.

We compared the trans-omic network at feeding with that at 16 h-fasting constructed in our previous study. Intermediate metabolites in glycolytic and nucleotide metabolism decreased in ob/ob mice at feeding but increased at fasting. Allosteric regulation reversely shifted between feeding and fasting, generally showing activation at feeding while inhibition at fasting in ob/ob mice. Transcriptional regulation was similar between feeding and fasting, generally showing inhibiting transcription factor regulations, activating enzyme protein regulations in ob/ob mice.

Previous work proposed several hierarchical extensions of this learning rule. However, it remains unclear when a flat (non-hierarchical) versus a hierarchical strategy is adaptive, or when it is implemented by humans. To address this question, current work applies a nested modelling approach to evaluate multiple models in multiple reinforcement learning environments both computationally (which approach performs best) and empirically (which approach fits human data best). We consider ten empirical datasets (N = 407) divided over three reinforcement learning environments. Our results demonstrate that different environments are best solved with different learning strategies; and that humans adaptively select the learning strategy that allows best performance. Specifically, while flat learning fitted best in less complex stable learning environments, humans employed more hierarchically complex models in more complex environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In cognitive neuroscience and psychology, reaction times are an important behavioral measure. However, in instrumental learning and goal-directed decision making experiments, findings often rely only on choice probabilities from a value-based model, instead of reaction times. Recent advancements have shown that it is possible to connect value-based decision models with reaction time models. However, typically these models do not provide an integrated account of both value-based choices and reaction times, but simply link two types of models. Here, we propose a novel integrative joint model of both choices and reaction times by combining a mechanistic account of Bayesian sequential decision making with a sampling procedure. This allows us to describe how internal uncertainty in the planning process shapes reaction time distributions. Specifically, we use a recent context-specific Bayesian forward planning model which we extend by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to obtain both choices and reaction times. As we will show this makes the sampler an integral part of the decision making process and enables us to reproduce, using simulations, well-known experimental findings in value based-decision making as well as classical inhibition and switching tasks. Specifically, we use the proposed model to explain both choice behavior and reaction times in instrumental learning and automatized behavior, in the Eriksen flanker task and in task switching. These findings show that the proposed joint behavioral model may describe common underlying processes in these different decision making paradigms.Author summary Many influential results in psychology and cognitive neuroscience rest on reaction time effects in behavioral experiments, for example in studies about human decision making. For decisions that rest on planning, findings often rely on analyses using specific computational models. Until recently, these models did not allow for analysis of reaction times. In this article we introduce a new model of how to explain both choices and reaction times in decision making experiments that involve planning. Importantly, the model explains how the brain can make good decisions quickly, even in the face of many potential choices and in complex environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Yet, we lack understanding on the role visual information sampling plays in this process, and its relation to the individual{\textquoteright}s priors. To bridge this gap, the eye-movements of 18 adult participants were recorded during a free-viewing object-recognition task using Dots stimuli (Moca et al., 2011). Participants viewed the stimuli in one of three orders: from most visible to least (Descending), least visible to most (Ascending) or in a randomised order (Random). This dictated the strength of their priors along the experiment. Adding to Moca et al.{\textquoteright}s original finding that visibility order influenced participants{\textquoteright} recognition performance and visual exploration, we found that while orders allowing for stronger priors generally led participants to visually sample more informative locations, this was not the case of Random participants. Indeed, they appeared to behave na{\"\i}vely, and their use of specific object-related priors seemed fully impaired, while they seemed to maintain the ability to use general task-related priors to guide their exploration. These findings have important implications for our understanding of perception, which appears markedly subjective even at the basic level of visual sampling and object perception.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Yet, our understanding of proprioceptive somatosensation in M1 at the laminar scale is limited, largely due to methodological challenges. Empirical findings in primates and rodents suggest a pronounced role of superficial cortical layers, but the involvement of deep layers has yet to be examined in humans. Submillimeter resolution fMRI has emerged in recent years, paving the way for the study of layer-dependent activity in humans (laminar fMRI). In the present study, laminar fMRI was employed to investigate the laminar pattern of proprioceptive somatosensation on M1 deep layer activation using passive finger movements as proprioceptive stimulation. Significant M1 deep layer activation was observed in response to proprioceptive stimulation across 10 healthy subjects using vascular space occupancy (VASO) at 7T. For further validation, two additional subjects were scanned using a balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequence with ultrahigh (0.3 mm) in-plane resolution, yielding converging results. These results were interpreted in the light of previous laminar fMRI studies and the active inference account of motor control. We suggest that a considerable proportion of M1 deep layer activation is due to proprioceptive influence and that deep layers of M1 constitute a key component in proprioceptive circuits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Objectives Previous research has demonstrated that mindfulness meditation is associated with a variety of benefits, including improved mental health. Researchers have suggested these benefits may be underpinned by differences in neural oscillations. However, previous studies measuring neural oscillations have not controlled for non-oscillatory neural activity, the power spectrum of which follows a 1/f distribution and contributes to power measurements within oscillation frequencies of interest. In this study, we applied recently developed methods to determine if past findings related to neural oscillations in meditation are present even after controlling for non-oscillatory 1/f activity.Methods 48 experienced meditators and 44 non-meditators provided resting electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Whole scalp EEG comparisons (topographical ANOVAs) were used to test for differences between meditators and non-meditators in the distribution or global power of activity for theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations, and for the 1/f components slope and intercept.Results Results indicated that meditators showed differences in theta, alpha, and gamma oscillatory power compared to non-meditators (all p \&lt; 0.05). Post-hoc testing suggested that the oscillatory differences were primarily driven by differences in the distribution of neural activity between meditators and non-meditators, rather than differences in the overall power across all scalp electrodes.Conclusion Our results suggest that experience with meditation is associated with higher oscillatory power and altered distributions of theta, alpha and gamma oscillations, even after controlling for non-oscillatory 1/f activity. Band-specific differences in oscillatory activity may be a mechanism through which meditation leads to neurophysiological benefits.Competing Interest StatementFunding Information PBF is supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia Practitioner Fellowship (6069070).

The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent stage of the model receives excitatory projections from both fluctuation-sensitive model neurons of the inferior colliculus (IC) and wide-dynamic-range model neurons of the cochlear nucleus. The response of the model MOC stage dynamically controls cochlear gain via simulated outer hair cells. In response to amplitude-modulated (AM) noise, firing rates of most IC neurons with band-enhanced modulation transfer functions in awake rabbits increase over a time course consistent with the dynamics of the MOC efferent feedback. These changes in the rates of IC neurons in awake rabbits were employed to adjust the parameters of the efferent stage of the proposed model. Responses of the proposed model to AM noise were able to simulate the increasing IC rate over time, while the model without the efferent system did not show this trend.

	abstract = {A fundamental property of sensory systems is their ability to detect novel stimuli in the ambient environment. The auditory brain contains neurons that decrease their response to repetitive sounds but increase their firing rate to novel or deviant stimuli; the difference between both responses is known as stimulus-specific adaptation or neuronal mismatch (nMM). Here, we tested the effect of microiontophoretic applications of ACh on the neuronal responses in the auditory cortex (AC) of anesthetized rats during an auditory oddball paradigm, including cascade controls. Results indicate that ACh modulates the nMM, affecting prediction error responses but not repetition suppression, and this effect is manifested predominantly in infragranular cortical layers. The differential effect of ACh on responses to standards, relative to deviants (in terms of averages and variances), were consistent with the representational sharpening that accompanies an increase in the precision of prediction errors. These findings suggest that ACh plays an important role in modulating prediction error signaling in the AC and gating the access of these signals to higher cognitive levels.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The muscle synergy is a guiding concept in motor control research that relies on the general notion of muscles {\textquoteleft}working together{\textquoteright} towards task performance. However, although the synergy concept has provided valuable insights into motor coordination, muscle interactions have not been fully characterised with respect to task performance. Here, we address this research gap by proposing a novel perspective to the muscle synergy that assigns specific functional roles to muscle couplings by characterising their task-relevance. Our novel perspective provides nuance to the muscle synergy concept, demonstrating how muscular interactions can {\textquoteleft}work together{\textquoteright} in different ways: a) irrespective of the task at hand but also b) redundantly or c) complementarily towards common task-goals. To establish this perspective, we leverage information- and network-theory and dimensionality reduction methods to include discrete and continuous task parameters directly during muscle synergy extraction. Specifically, we introduce co-information as a measure of the task relevance of muscle interactions and use it to categorise such interactions as task-irrelevant (present across tasks), redundant (shared task information) or synergistic (different task information). To demonstrate these types of interactions in real data, we firstly apply the framework in a simple way, revealing its added functional and physiological relevance with respect to current approaches. We then apply the framework to large-scale datasets and extract generalizable and scale-invariant representations consisting of subnetworks of synchronised muscle couplings and distinct temporal patterns. The representations effectively capture the functional interplay between task end-goals and biomechanical affordances and the concurrent processing of functionally similar and complementary task information. The proposed framework unifies the capabilities of current approaches in capturing distinct motor features while providing novel insights and research opportunities through a nuanced perspective to the muscle synergy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We further developed simple and intuitive experimental paradigms that enabled us to distinguish the distinct roles of subpopulations of neurons in the hypothalamus. Our results show that AgRP neurons and LHLepR neurons are consistent with need and motivation, respectively. Our study provides a parsimonious understanding of how distinct hypothalamic neurons separately encode need and motivation to produce adaptive behaviours for maintaining homeostasis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Animals are motivated to acquire knowledge of their world. They seek information that does not influence reward outcomes suggesting that information has intrinsic value. We have asked whether mice value information and whether a representation of information value can be detected in mouse orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We have developed an odor-based behavioral task in which mice choose to acquire information even though it does not alter the reward outcome. We observe that mice choose to acquire knowledge about uncertain reward and are willing to sacrifice water for information suggesting that knowledge is of intrinsic value to a mouse. We imaged neural activity in OFC while mice performed the information seeking task and observed different but overlapping populations of neurons responsive to odors predictive of information and odors predictive of water reward. Moreover, a nonlinear latent variable model recapitulated these distinct representations in the low-dimensional dynamics of OFC neuronal population activity. These data suggest that mice have evolved distinct pathways in OFC that represent the intrinsic value of knowledge and the extrinsic value of water reward. Thus, the desire to acquire knowledge is conserved in mice and the value of knowledge is represented in the OFC.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, we quantified 23,126 phosphosites in skeletal muscle of five genetically distinct mouse strains in two dietary environments, with and without acute in vivo insulin stimulation. Almost half of the insulin-regulated phosphoproteome was modified by genetic background on an ordinary diet, and high-fat high-sugar feeding affected insulin signalling in a strain-dependent manner. Our data revealed coregulated subnetworks within the insulin signalling pathway, expanding our understanding of the pathway{\textquoteright}s organisation. Furthermore, associating diverse signalling responses with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake uncovered regulators of muscle insulin responsiveness, including the regulatory phosphosite S469 on Pfkfb2, a key activator of glycolysis. Finally, we confirmed the role of glycolysis in modulating insulin action in insulin resistance. Our results underscore the significance of genetics in shaping global signalling responses and their adaptability to environmental changes, emphasizing the utility of studying biological diversity with phosphoproteomics to discover key regulatory mechanisms of complex traits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In our laboratory, the use of round-window ECochG recordings in chinchillas has allowed a better understanding of auditory efferent functioning. In previous works, we gave evidence of the corticofugal modulation of auditory-nerve and cochlear responses during visual attention and working memory. However, whether these cognitive top-down mechanisms to the most peripheral structures of the auditory pathway are also active during audiovisual crossmodal stimulation is unknown. Here, we introduce a new technique, wireless ECochG to record compound-action potentials of the auditory nerve (CAP), cochlear microphonics (CM), and round-window noise (RWN) in awake chinchillas during a paradigm of crossmodal (visual and auditory) stimulation. A total of four chinchillas were successfully recorded during the experimental protocol. There were non-significant differences in CAP, CM, and RWN amplitudes in response to auditory stimulation alone (clicks and tones) as compared to audio-visual crossmodal stimulation. These results suggest that cognition, such as attention or working memory, is needed for the corticofugal modulation of auditory-nerve and cochlear responses. In addition, we introduce the use of wireless ECochG in animal models as a useful tool for translational research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We analyzed placebo analgesia in a large fMRI study (N = 392), including placebo effects on brain responses to noxious stimuli. Placebo treatment caused robust analgesia in both conditioned thermal and unconditioned mechanical pain. Placebo did not decrease fMRI activity in nociceptive pain regions, including the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) and pre-registered spinothalamic pathway regions, with strong support from Bayes Factor analyses. However, placebo treatment affected activity in pre-registered analyses of a second neuromarker, the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS), and several associated a priori brain regions related to motivation and value, in both thermal and mechanical pain. Individual differences in behavioral analgesia were correlated with neural changes in both thermal and mechanical pain.

	abstract = {Cells respond to environmental and developmental stimuli by remodeling their transcriptomes through regulation of both mRNA transcription and mRNA decay. A central goal of biology is identifying the global set of regulatory relationships between factors that control mRNA production and degradation and their target transcripts and construct a predictive model of gene expression. Regulatory relationships are typically identified using transcriptome measurements and causal inference algorithms. RNA kinetic parameters are determined experimentally by employing run-on or metabolic labeling (e.g. 4-thiouracil) methods that allow transcription and decay rates to be separately measured. Here, we develop a deep learning model, trained with single-cell RNA-seq data, that both infers causal regulatory relationships and estimates RNA kinetic parameters. The resulting in silico model predicts future gene expression states and can be perturbed to simulate the effect of transcription factor changes.We acquired model training data by sequencing the transcriptomes of 175,000 individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that were subject to an external perturbation and continuously sampled over a one hour period. The rate of change for each transcript was calculated on a per-cell basis to estimate RNA velocity. We then trained a deep learning model with transcriptome and RNA velocity data to calculate time-dependent estimates of mRNA production and decay rates. By separating RNA velocity into transcription and decay rates, we show that rapamycin treatment causes existing ribosomal protein transcripts to be rapidly destabilized, while production of new transcripts gradually slows over the course of an hour.The neural network framework we present is designed to explicitly model causal regulatory relationships between transcription factors and their genes, and shows superior performance to existing models on the basis of recovery of known regulatory relationships. We validated the predictive power of the model by perturbing transcription factors in silico and comparing transcriptome-wide effects with experimental data. Our study represents the first step in constructing a complete, predictive, biophysical model of gene expression regulation.Competing Interest StatementRB is currently VP of Machine Learning for Drug Discovery at Genentech.

Combining a novel uncertain shock anticipation paradigm that allows precise modulation of the level of momentary anxious arousal during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with multivariate predictive modeling, we trained a brain model that accurately predicted the intensity of subjective experience of anxious arousal on the population and individual level. In a series of analyses utilizing available fMRI datasets, we further demonstrate that the signature specifically predicted anxious anticipation and was not sensitive in predicting pain, general anticipation or unspecific arousal. The signature was functionally and spatially distinguishable from representations of subjective fear or negative affect. We developed a sensitive, generalizable, and specific neuromarker for subjective anxious arousal experienced during uncertain threat anticipation that can facilitate model development and clinical translation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Predictive processing models suggest that a brain decides actions through inference using its internal generative model over the world{\textquoteright}s states and their transitions. Most of the predictive processing models have been formalized using explicit representations of the probability distributions, with explicit structures and parameters. They are difficult to learn in general and needs explanation about representation of structure and parameters of distributions, and the method for statistical arithmetic on them, each of which are questions not easy to answer. In this study, we explore an alternative representation for predictive processing which is based on an implicit model known as generative adversarial networks, which has been widely explored recently in machine learning studies as they can learn a distribution directly from data. We demonstrate how a generative adversarial network can be trained to learn an implicit generative model of motor dynamics. And then, we show that such a model can perform approximate inference using the trained model, providing the necessary computations for both the forward and inverse model of motor control. Our framework may provide another formalization for brain{\textquoteright}s inference model, especially for learning process. Additionally, we suggest that the functional architecture of the cortical-basal ganglia circuit may modeled as the generator and discriminator in the generative adversarial network model.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In this study, we asked how the brain represents values, uncertainty, and resolves the uncertainty under the active inference framework in the exploration-exploitation trade-off. 25 participants performed a contextual two-step two-armed bandit task, with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. By comparing the fltting results from the active inference and reinforcement learning model, we show that active inference can better capture the exploration instinct of humans, which helps resolve the uncertainty of the environment. The EEG sensor-level results show that the activity in the frontal, central, and parietal regions is associated with uncertainty, while activity in the frontal and central brain regions is associated with risk. The EEG source-level results indicate that the expected free energy is encoded in the lateral occipital cortex and the uncertainty in the middle temporal pole. Our study dissociates the expected free energy and the uncertainty in active inference theory and their neural correlates, suggesting the reliability of active inference in characterizing cognitive processes of human decisions. It provides behavioral and neural evidence of active inference in decision processes and insights into the neural mechanism of human decision under different kinds of uncertainty.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {When facing an unfamiliar environment, animals need to explore to gain new knowledge about which actions provide reward, but also put the newly acquired knowledge to use as quickly as possible. Optimal reinforcement learning strategies should therefore assess the uncertainties of these action{\textendash} reward associations and utilise them to inform decision making. We propose a novel model whereby direct and indirect striatal pathways act together to estimate both the mean and variance of reward distributions, and mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons provide transient novelty signals, facilitating effective uncertainty-driven exploration. We utilised electrophysiological recording data to verify our model of the basal ganglia, and we fitted exploration strategies derived from the model to data from behavioural experiments. We also compared the performance of directed exploration strategies inspired by our basal ganglia model with classic variants of upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy in simulation. The exploration strategies inspired by the basal ganglia model performed better than the classic algorithms in simulation in some cases, and we found qualitatively similar results in fitting model to behavioural data compared with the fitting of more idealised normative models with less implementation level detail. Overall, our results suggest that transient dopamine levels in the basal ganglia that encode novelty could contribute to an uncertainty representation which efficiently drives exploration in reinforcement learning.Author summary Humans and other animals learn from rewards and losses resulting from their actions to maximise their chances of survival. In many cases, a trial-and-error process is necessary to determine the most rewarding action in a certain context. During this process, determining how much resource should be allocated to acquiring information ({\textquotedblleft}exploration{\textquotedblright}) and how much should be allocated to utilising the existing information to maximise reward ({\textquotedblleft}exploitation{\textquotedblright}) is key to the overall effectiveness, i.e., the maximisation of total reward obtained with a certain amount of effort. We propose a theory whereby an area within the mammalian brain called the basal ganglia integrates current knowledge about the mean reward, reward uncertainty and novelty of an action in order to implement an algorithm which optimally allocates resources between exploration and exploitation. We verify our theory using behavioural experiments and electrophysiological recording, and show in simulations that the model also achieves good performance in comparison with established benchmark algorithms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Reducing a model as complex as the surrounding dynamic environment into a small set of simpler hypotheses is a reasonable cognitive solution, but how can the brain compare and choose among dynamic hypotheses? Recent advances in Bayesian Model Reduction have led to innovative solutions to actively infer the state of affairs of the world and perform discrete planning with continuous signals, but dealing with highly dynamic contexts is a difficult matter. We propose that choosing among flexible hypotheses is possible by using reduced priors sampled from the dynamics of a generative model. Each reduced prior corresponds to an alternative future world constantly generated from the current observations, which the agent can use to accumulate evidence for a discrete hypothesis. We tested the approach on two everyday tasks: inferring a dynamic trajectory and grasping a moving object, which the model solved with high accuracy. Our study may thus shed light on how agents can smoothly generate and infer static intentions that result in dynamic behaviors, and on the specific role of intention precisions in motor learning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Depth estimation is an ill-posed problem: objects of different shapes or dimensions, even if at different distances, may project to the same image on the retina. Our brain uses several cues for depth estimation, including monocular cues such as motion parallax and binocular cues like diplopia. However, it is still unclear how the computations required for depth estimation are implemented in biologically plausible ways. State-of-the-art approaches to depth estimation based on deep neural networks implicitly describe the brain as a hierarchical feature detector. Instead, we propose an alternative approach that casts depth estimation as a problem of active inference. We show that depth can be inferred by inverting a hierarchical generative model that simultaneously predicts the eyes projections from a 2D belief over an object. Model inversion consists of a series of biologically plausible, homogeneous transformations based on Predictive Coding principles. Under the plausible assumption of a nonuniform fovea resolution, depth estimation favors an active vision strategy that fixates the object with the eyes, rendering the depth belief more accurate. This strategy is not realized by first fixating on a target and then estimating the depth, but by combining the two processes through action-perception cycles, with a similar mechanism of the saccades during object recognition. The proposed approach requires only local (top-down and bottom-up) message passing that can be implemented in biologically plausible neural circuits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Behavioral studies of perceptual decisions suggest that such history-dependent biases affect the accumulation of evidence and can be adapted to the correlation structure of the sensory environment. Here, we systematically varied this correlation structure while human participants performed a canonical perceptual choice task. We tracked the trial-by-trial variations of history biases via behavioral modeling and of a neural signature of decision formation via magnetoencephalography (MEG). The history bias was flexibly adapted to the environment and exerted a selective effect on the build-up (not baseline level) of action-selective motor cortical activity during decision formation. This effect added to the impact of the current stimulus. We conclude that the build-up of action plans in human motor cortical circuits is shaped by dynamic prior expectations that result from an adaptive interaction with the environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we show, with direct recordings from the human hippocampus and visual cortex, that after exposure to unpredictable visual stimulus streams, hippocampal ripple activity increases in frequency and duration prior to stimulus presentation, indicating context and experience-dependent prediction of predictability. Pre-stimulus hippocampal ripples suppress changes in visual (occipital) cortex gamma activity associated with uncertainty, and modulate post-stimulus prediction error gamma responses in higher-level visual (fusiform) cortex to surprising (i.e., unpredicted) stimuli.

	abstract = {Perception is often modelled as a process of active inference, whereby prior expectations are combined with noisy sensory measurements to estimate the structure of the world. This mathematical framework has proven critical to understanding perception, cognition, motor control, and social interaction. While theoretical work has shown how priors can be computed from environmental statistics, their neural instantiation could be realised through multiple competing encoding schemes. Using a data-driven approach, here we extract the brain{\textquoteright}s representation of visual orientation and compare this with simulations from different sensory coding schemes. We found that the tuning of the human visual system is highly conditional on stimulus-specific variations in a way that is not predicted by previous proposals. We further show that the adopted encoding scheme effectively embeds an environmental prior for natural image statistics within the sensory measurement, providing the functional architecture necessary for optimal inference in the earliest stages of cortical processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {How does the brain support {\textquoteleft}wellbeing{\textquoteright}? Because it is a multidimensional construct, it is likely the product of multiple co-active brain networks that vary across individuals. This is perhaps why prior neuroimaging studies have found inconsistent anatomical associations with wellbeing. Furthermore, these used {\textquoteleft}laboratory-style{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}resting-state{\textquoteright} methods not amenable to finding manifold networks. To address these issues, we had participants watch a full-length romantic comedy-drama film during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We hypothesised that individual differences in wellbeing measured before scanning would be correlated with individual differences in brain networks associated with {\textquoteleft}embodied{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}narrative{\textquoteright} self-related processing. Indeed, searchlight spatial inter-participant representational similarity and subsequent analyses revealed seven sets of co-activated networks associated with individual differences in wellbeing. Two were {\textquoteleft}embodied self{\textquoteright} related, including brain regions associated with autonomic and affective processing. Three sets were {\textquoteleft}narrative self{\textquoteright} related, involving speech, language, and autobiographical memory related regions. Finally, two sets of visual-attention related networks emerged. These results suggest that the neurobiology of wellbeing in the real-world is supported by diverse but functionally definable and separable sets of networks. This has implications for psychotherapy where individualised interventions might target, e.g., neuroplasticity in language-related narrative over embodied self or visual-attentional related processes.Significance Statement Humans deeply care about their own and others wellbeing. Yet, the role the brain plays in generating it remains unestablished, perhaps because wellbeing means different things to different people. Here, we asked whether individual differences in wellbeing are associated with differences in brain networks supporting {\textquoteleft}embodied{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}narrative{\textquoteright} selves. That is, how people feel in their bodies and their emotions might contribute more to wellbeing in some individuals. In others, the stories people tell about themselves might be a more important determinant. Supporting this, we found that different self-ratings of wellbeing are associated with different embodied and narrative self-related networks. We also found differences in networks associated with visual-attention, suggesting that what people attend to in the visual world also contributes to wellbeing. These results have implications for how mental health professionals and other individuals might intervene to improve wellbeing by differentially focusing on embodied-self, narrative-self, or visual-attentional related processes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Statistical learning starts at an early age and is intimately linked to brain development and the emergence of individuality. Through such a long period of statistical learning, the brain updates and constructs statistical models, with the model{\textquoteright}s individuality changing based on the type and degree of stimulation received. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process are unknown.This paper argues three main points of statistical learning, including 1) cognitive individuality based on {\textquotedblleft}reliability{\textquotedblright} of prediction, 2) the construction of information {\textquotedblleft}hierarchy{\textquotedblright} through chunking, and 3) the acquisition of {\textquotedblleft}1-3Hz rhythm{\textquotedblright} that is essential for early language and music learning. We developed a Hierarchical Bayesian Statistical Learning (HBSL) model that takes into account both reliability and hierarchy, mimicking the statistical learning processes of the brain. Using this model, we conducted a simulation experiment to visualize the temporal dynamics of perception and production processes through statistical learning. By modulating the sensitivity to sound stimuli, we simulated three cognitive models with different reliability on bottom-up sensory stimuli relative to top-down prior prediction: hypo-sensitive, normal-sensitive, and hyper-sensitive models.We suggested that statistical learning plays a crucial role in the acquisition of 1-3 Hz rhythm. Moreover, a hyper-sensitive model quickly learned the sensory statistics but became fixated on their internal model, making it difficult to generate new information, whereas a hypo-sensitive model has lower learning efficiency but may be more likely to generate new information. Various individual characteristics may not necessarily confer an overall advantage over others, as there may be a trade-off between learning efficiency and the ease of generating new information. This study has the potential to shed light on the heterogeneous nature of statistical learning, as well as the paradoxical phenomenon in which individuals with certain cognitive traits that impede specific types of perceptual abilities exhibit superior performance in creative contexts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we examined whether the neural synchronization of the DMN tracked the appearances of characters with different narrative roles (i.e., protagonists versus antagonists) when viewing highly engaging, socially rich audiovisual narratives. Using inter-subject correlation analysis on two independent, publicly available movie-watching functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets (Sherlock and The Grand Budapest Hotel), we computed whole-brain neural synchronization during the appearance of the protagonists and antagonists. Results showed that the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which are components of the DMN, had higher ISC values during the appearance of the protagonists compared to the antagonists. Importantly, these findings were commonly observed in both datasets. We discuss the present results in the context of information integration and emotional empathy, which are relevant functions known to be supported by the DMN.

However, devising generative models to control complex kinematic chains like the human body is challenging. We introduce a novel Active Inference architecture that affords a simple but effective mapping from extrinsic to intrinsic coordinates via inference and easily scales up to drive complex kinematic chains. Rich goals can be specified in both intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates using attractive or repulsive forces.

A multimodal functional characterization of these processes can shed light on the disease mechanisms and the effect of drugs. Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) is a mass-spectrometry based technique assessing changes in thermal protein stability that can serve as proxies of functional changes of the proteome. These unique insights of TPP can complement those obtained by other omics technologies. Here, we show how TPP can be integrated with phosphoproteomics and transcriptomics in a network-based approach using COSMOS, a framework for causal integration of multi-omics, to provide an integrated view of transcription factors, kinases and proteins with altered thermal stability. This allowed us to recover known mechanistic consequences of PARP inhibition in ovarian cancer cells on cell cycle and DNA damage response in detail and to uncover new insights into drug response mechanisms related to interferon and hippo signaling. We found that TPP complements the other omics data and allowed us to obtain a network model with higher coverage of the main underlying mechanisms. These results illustrate the added value of TPP, and more generally the power of network models to integrate the information provided by different omics technologies. We anticipate that this strategy can be used to broadly integrate functional proteomics with other omics to study complex molecular processes.Competing Interest StatementSaez-Rodriguez J. reports funding from GSK, Pfizer and Sanofi and fees/honoraria from Travere Therapeutics, Stadapharm, Astex, Pfizer and Grunenthal.

	abstract = {The Heartbeat Evoked Potential (HEP) is an EEG fluctuation that reflects the cortical processing of cardiac signals. HEP amplitude increases during various tasks involving cardiac interoception. Recent research has also indicated that HEP amplitude and cardiac interoceptive accuracy are higher during exhalation compared to inhalation. This difference may be due to the suppression of heartbeat-related sensations during inhalation and the amplification of sensations during exhalation through attentional mechanisms. Despite significant advancements in HEP research, the interactions between the HEP, interoceptive attention, and respiration are still unclear. In this study, we developed a novel experimental paradigm to investigate the relationship between HEP amplitude and respiratory phases during tasks that involve attention to cardiac interoception, non-cardiac interoception (specifically, respiration), and exteroceptive stimuli. The tasks included the Heartbeat Counting Task and the Breath Counting Task as interoceptive tasks, as well as the Cardiac-Tone Counting Task and the Breath-Tone Counting Task as exteroceptive tasks. Results demonstrated significant increases in HEP amplitude during the Heartbeat Counting Task compared to the Cardiac-Tone Counting Task and the Breath Counting Task, mostly observed over fronto-central electrodes in a late time-window. Notably, the amplitude increases during the Heartbeat Counting Task were primarily driven by HEPs recorded during exhalation, while inhalation had minimal impact. These findings align with the predictive coding model of interoceptive perception, suggesting that HEP amplitude reflects a precision-weighting process of prediction errors related to cardiac sensations that is specifically influenced by attention directed toward the heart. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the crucial role of exhalation in this precision-weighting process. These results may have considerable implications for the development of respiratory interventions to fine-tune cardiac interoception.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Research suggests that a fast, capacity-limited working memory (WM) system and a slow, incremental reinforcement learning (RL) system jointly contribute to instrumental learning. Thus, situations that strain WM resources alter instrumental learning: under WM loads, learning becomes slow and incremental, the reliance on computationally efficient learning increases, and action selection becomes more random. It is also suggested that Pavlovian learning influences people{\textquoteright}s behavior during instrumental learning by providing hard-wired instinctive responses including approach to reward predictors and avoidance of punishment predictors. However, it remains unknown how constraints on WM resources affect instrumental learning under Pavlovian influence. Thus, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (N=49) in which participants completed an instrumental learning task with Pavlovian{\textendash}instrumental conflict (the orthogonalized go/no-go task) both with and without extra WM load. Behavioral and computational modeling analyses revealed that WM load reduced the learning rate and increased random choice, without affecting Pavlovian bias. Model-based fMRI analysis revealed that WM load strengthened RPE signaling in the striatum. Moreover, under WM load, the striatum showed weakened connectivity with the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when computing reward expectations. These results suggest that the limitation of cognitive resources by WM load promotes slow and incremental learning through the weakened cooperation between WM and RL; such limitation also makes action selection more random, but it does not directly affect the balance between instrumental and Pavlovian systems.Author Summary Among multiple decision-making systems of humans and animals, the Pavlovian system is known for promoting automatic and instinctive behaviors. Understanding the Pavlovian influence on decision-making can offer valuable insights into the mechanism of impulsive and addictive behaviors. Previous studies suggested that prefrontal executive control can be important in regulating the Pavlovian influence. We tested if reducing cognitive resources available for executive control modulates the Pavlovian influence, by adding WM load to an instrumental learning task where Pavlovian influence is beneficial in some conditions but detrimental in others. Contrary to our expectation, constraining cognitive resources with WM load failed to significantly change the contribution of Pavlovian system. Nonetheless, with behavioral analysis and computational modeling, we revealed that WM load promotes slower learning and makes decisions noisier in an instrumental learning task with Pavlovian components. FMRI analysis revealed that WM load strengthens the RPE signaling in striatum upon observing the outcome and weakens the functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the striatum before making a decision. The current study contributes to understanding how cognitive resource constraints alter learning and decision-making under Pavlovian influence as well as the neural mechanisms of those effects.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Dominant motor control theories propose that the brain predicts and attenuates the somatosensory consequences of actions, referred to as somatosensory attenuation. Support comes from psychophysical and neuroimaging studies showing that touch applied on a passive hand elicits attenuated perceptual and neural responses if it is actively generated by one{\textquoteright}s other hand, compared to identical touch from an external origin. However, recent experimental findings have challenged this view by providing psychophysical evidence that the perceived intensity of touch on the passive hand is enhanced if the active hand does not receive touch simultaneously with the passive hand (somatosensory enhancement) and by further attributing attenuation to the double tactile stimulation of the hands upon contact. Here, we directly contrasted the hypotheses of the attenuation and enhancement models regarding how action influences somatosensory perception by manipulating whether the active hand contacts the passive hand. We further assessed somatosensory perception in the absence of any predictive cues in a condition that turned out to be essential for interpreting the experimental findings. In three preregistered experiments, we demonstrate that action does not enhance the predicted touch (Experiment 1), that the previously reported {\textquotedblleft}enhancement{\textquotedblright} effects are driven by the reference condition used (Experiment 2), and that self-generated touch is robustly attenuated regardless of whether the two hands make contact (Experiment 3). Our results provide conclusive evidence that action does not enhance but attenuates predicted touch and prompt a reappraisal of recent experimental findings upon which theoretical frameworks proposing a perceptual enhancement by action prediction are based.HighlightsDominant motor control theories propose that action attenuates or cancels predicted touch.Recent theories propose that action enhances predicted touch.We show that action does not enhance but attenuates predicted touch.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Interpersonal touch is an important part of our social and emotional interactions. How these physical, skin-to-skin touch expressions are processed in the peripheral nervous system is not well understood. From single-unit microneurography recordings in humans, we evaluated the capacity of six subtypes of cutaneous afferents to differentiate perceptually distinct social touch expressions. By leveraging conventional statistical analyses and classification analyses using convolutional neural networks and support vector machines, we found that single units of multiple Aβ subtypes, especially slowly adapting type II (SA-II) and fast adapting hair follicle afferents (HFA), can reliably differentiate the skin contact of those expressions at accuracies similar to those perceptually. Rapidly adapting field (Field) afferents exhibit lower accuracies, whereas C-tactile (CT), fast adapting Pacinian corpuscles (FA-II), and muscle spindle (MS) afferents can barely differentiate the expressions, despite responding to the stimuli. We then identified the most informative firing patterns of SA-II and HFA afferents{\textquoteright} spike trains, which indicate that an average duration of 3-4 s of firing provides sufficient discriminative information. Those two subtypes also exhibit robust tolerance to shifts in spike-timing of up to 10 ms. A greater shift in spike-timing, however, drastically compromises an afferent{\textquoteright}s discrimination capacity, and can change a firing pattern{\textquoteright}s envelope to resemble that of another expression. Altogether, the findings indicate that SA-II and HFA afferents differentiate the skin contact of social touch at time scales relevant for such interactions, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than those relevant for discriminating non-social touch inputs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The brain continuously anticipates the energetic needs of the body and prepares to meet those needs before they arise, a process called allostasis. In support of allostasis, the brain continually models the internal state of the body, a process called interoception. Using published tract-tracing studies in non-human animals as a guide, we previously identified a large-scale system supporting allostasis and interoception in the human brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla. In the present study, we replicated and extended this system in humans using 7 Tesla fMRI (N = 91), improving the precision of subgenual and pregenual anterior cingulate topography as well as brainstem nuclei mapping. We verified over 90\% of the anatomical connections in the hypothesized allostatic-interoceptive system observed in non-human animal research. We also identified functional connectivity hubs verified in tract-tracing studies but not previously detected using 3 Tesla fMRI. Finally, we demonstrated that individuals with stronger fMRI connectivity between system hubs self-reported greater interoceptive awareness, building on construct validity evidence from our earlier paper. Taken together, these results strengthen evidence for the existence of a whole-brain system supporting interoception in the service of allostasis and we consider the implications for mental and physical health.Significance Statement We used ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI to replicate and extend a large-scale brain system supporting interoception and allostasis, entwined processes crucial to the core brain function of coordinating and regulating the internal systems of the body. In particular, we mapped the subcortical extents of this system, several of which are small brainstem nuclei only recently delineated at 7 Tesla. Our findings suggest that investigations of distributed brain networks should not be restricted to the cerebral cortex. We emphasize bodily regulation as a whole-brain phenomenon and highlight its implications for mental and physical health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Background Huntington{\textquoteright}s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder caused by an expansion in the CAG repeat tract of the huntingtin (HTT) gene resulting in a triad of behavioural, cognitive, and motor defects. Current knowledge of disease pathogenesis remains incomplete, and no disease course-modifying interventions are in clinical use. We have previously reported the development and characterisation of the OVT73 transgenic sheep model of HD. OVT73 captures an early prodromal phase of the disease with an absence of motor symptomatology even at 5-years of age and no detectable striatal cell loss.Methods To better understand the disease-initiating events we have undertaken a single nuclei transcriptome study of the striatum of an extensively studied cohort of 5-year-old OVT73 HD sheep and age matched wild-type controls.Results We have identified transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptors in OVT73 medium spiny neurons, the cell type preferentially lost early in HD. This observation supports the glutamate excitotoxicity hypothesis as an early neurodegeneration cascade-initiating process. Moreover, we also observed the downstream consequences of excitotoxic stress, including a downregulation of transcription of components for the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. We also found that pathways whose activity has been proposed to reduce excitotoxicity, including the CREB family of transcription factors (CREB1, ATF2, ATF4 and ATF7) were transcriptionally downregulated.Conclusions To our knowledge, the OVT73 model is the first large mammalian HD model that exhibits transcriptomic signatures of an excitotoxic process in the absence of neuronal loss. Our results suggest that glutamate excitotoxicity is a disease-initiating process. Addressing this biochemical defect early may prevent neuronal loss and avoid the more complex secondary consequences precipitated by cell death.Competing Interest StatementJ.F.G. was a founder and scientific advisory board member with a financial interest in Triplet Therapeutics Inc.

	abstract = {The perception of the internal milieu is thought to reflect beliefs and prior knowledge about the expected state of the body, rather than only actual interoceptive states. This study investigated whether heartbeat perception could be illusorily distorted towards prior subjective beliefs, such that threat expectations suffice to induce a false perception of increased heartbeat frequency. Participants were instructed to focus on their cardiac activity and report their heartbeat, either tapping along to it (Experiment 1) or silently counting (Experiment 2) while ECG was recorded. While completing this task, different cues provided valid predictive information about the intensity of an upcoming cutaneous stimulation (high- vs. low- pain). Results showed that participants expected a heart rate increase over the anticipation of high- vs. low-pain stimuli and that this belief was perceptually instantiated, as shown by their interoceptive reports. Importantly, the perceived increase was not mirrored by the real heart rate. Perceptual modulations were absent when participants executed the same task but with an exteroceptive stimulus (Experiment 3). The findings reveal, for the first time, an interoceptive illusion of increased heartbeats elicited by threat expectancy and shed new light on interoceptive processes through the lenses of Bayesian predictive processes, providing tantalizing insights into how such illusory phenomena may intersect with the recognition and regulation of people{\textquoteright}s internal states.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Object processing is fundamental to visual perception, and understanding its neural substrates informs many cognitive and computational visual processing models. Thus far, most human studies have used passive viewing paradigms, during which self-driven behavior, such as eye movements, is constrained, and brain activity is evoked by abrupt stimuli onsets. This artificial dissociation of perception and action ignores the natural dynamics of visual processing. Thus, conclusions based on such passive viewing paradigms may not apply to active vision. Here, we study the human neural correlates of category representations during active visual processing by time-locking EEG to self-driven fixations during visual search for natural objects. We combine the deconvolution of overlapping responses to consecutive fixations with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode object categories from responses to single fixation. We bridge the active and passive viewing literature by comparing the temporal dynamics of multivariate object representations during free visual search (active viewing) and rapid serial visual presentation (passive viewing), leveraging the high temporal resolution of EEG. We found that categorical information, at different levels of abstraction, can be decoded from single fixations during natural visual processing, and cross-condition decoding revealed that object representations are similar between active and passive viewing conditions. However, representational dynamics emerge significantly earlier in active compared to passive conditions, likely due to the availability of predictive information in free viewing. We highlight methodological considerations for combining MVPA with deconvolution methods.Significance Statement Understanding the neural correlates of visual perception is crucial for advancing cognitive and computational models of human vision. This study bridges the gap between passive- and active-vision literature while shedding light on the intricate relationship between perception and action in visual processing. Although eye movements are a fundamental behavior through which visual information is naturally sampled, most neuroimaging studies probe the brain by presenting stimuli abruptly at the center of the screen while participants refrain from moving their eyes. We investigated EEG correlates of visual processing during active visual search and demonstrated that object categories of naturally fixated objects can be decoded from the EEG. We provide novel findings regarding the dynamics of active, compared to passive, visual processing, while contributing to the advancement of EEG analysis methodology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Predictive processing theories, which model the brain as a {\textquotedblleft}prediction machine{\textquotedblright}, explain a wide range of cognitive functions, including learning, perception and action. Furthermore, it is increasingly accepted that aberrant prediction tendencies play a crucial role in psychiatric disorders. Given this explanatory value for clinical psychiatry, prediction tendencies are often implicitly conceptualised as individual traits or as tendencies that generalise across situations. As this has not yet explicitly been shown, in the current study, we quantify to what extent the individual tendency to anticipate sensory features of high probability generalises across modalities. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded brain activity while participants were presented a sequence of four different (either visual or auditory) stimuli, which changed according to predefined transitional probabilities of two entropy levels: ordered vs. random. Our results show that, on a group-level, under conditions of low entropy, stimulus features of high probability are preactivated in the auditory but not in the visual modality. Crucially, the magnitude of the individual tendency to predict sensory events seems not to correlate between the two modalities. Furthermore, reliability statistics indicate poor internal consistency, suggesting that the measures from the different modalities are unlikely to reflect a single, common cognitive process. In sum, our findings suggest that quantification and interpretation of individual prediction tendencies cannot be generalised across modalities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Analysis of motor cortical activity has consistently found, and imputed functional significance upon, signals that correlate with limb muscle activity4{\textendash}6 or kinematics7{\textendash}9. But a selective role in driving certain muscle activity patterns might rely on signals related only to those patterns and not others. Here we quantified the direct influence of forelimb motor cortex on muscle activity throughout a naturalistic climbing behavior, finding that this influence is selective for, and highly dependent upon, muscle activity states. We used multielectrode array recordings to identify linear combinations (components) of motor cortical activity patterns that covary with this influence. We find that these components differ substantially from those that covary with muscle activity or kinematics. Our results reveal a direct motor cortical influence on muscles that is selective within a motor behavior and reliant on a previously undescribed neural activity subspace.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {We perceive the external world through both externally generated and self-generated sensory stimuli (i.e., passive and active perception). While the performance in passive perception is improved by training or repetition through the functional and structural reorganization of the central nervous system (i.e., perceptual learning), the mechanisms by which perceptual learning occurs in active perception remain unclear. Here, we sought to explore the mechanisms underlying the improvement of active somatosensory perception and sensorimotor skills through active perceptual learning. Because we previously found that active perceptual learning depends on the expertise of the motor task to be performed, this study focused primarily on trained individuals. To this end, active haptic training (AHT) that targets the active somatosensory perception during the piano keystroke was used as a means of inducing active perceptual learning. We found four main results. First, participants actively modulated the muscle coordination patterns to optimize the movements required by the task through AHT without any explicit instruction on it by the experimenter, suggesting the involvement of active exploration in active perceptual learning. Second, AHT increased the relative reliance on afferent sensory information relative to the predicted one during the piano keystroke. Third, perceptual sensitivity of externally generated keystroke motions remained unchanged through AHT. Finally, AHT improved feedback control of repetitive keystroke movements in expert pianists. These results suggest that active perceptual learning involves changes in both the predictive integration process and active exploration and that the improved feedback control of fine movements benefits from the improvement in active perception.Significant statement Our ability to perceive both externally generated and self-generated sensory stimuli can be enhanced through training, known as passive and active perceptual learning. Here, we sought to explore the mechanisms underlying active perceptual learning by using active haptic training (AHT), which has been demonstrated to enhance the somatosensory perception of a finger in a trained motor skill. First, AHT reorganized the muscular coordination during the piano keystroke. Second, AHT increased the relative reliance on afferent sensory information relative to predicted one, in contrast to no increment of overall perceptual sensitivity. Finally, AHT improved feedback movement control of keystrokes. These results suggest that active perceptual learning involves active exploration and adaptation of predictive sensory integration, which underlies the co-enhancement of active perception and feedback control of movements.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we ask whether it is possible to induce pain expectations by providing false faster (vs. slower) acoustic cardiac feedback before administering electrical cutaneous shocks, and test whether these expectations will shape both the perception of pain and the body{\textquoteright}s physiological state toward prior predictions. Results confirmed that faster cardiac feedback elicited pain expectations that affected both perceptual pain judgments and the body{\textquoteright}s physiological response. Perceptual pain judgments were biased towards the expected level of pain, such that participants illusorily perceived identical noxious stimuli as more intense and unpleasant. Physiological changes mirrored the predicted level of pain, such that participants{\textquoteright} actual cardiac response in anticipation of pain stimuli showed a deceleration in heart rates, coherently with the well-known orienting cardiac response in anticipation of threatening stimuli (Experiment 1). In a control experiment, such perceptual and cardiac modulations were dramatically reduced when the feedback reproduced an exteroceptive, instead of interoceptive cardiac feedback (Experiment 2). These findings show for the first time that cardiac feedback manipulation can be conceptualized in terms of an interoceptive inference that modulates both our perception and the physiological state of the body, thereby actively generating the interoceptive and autonomic consequences that have been predicted.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The theory of autopoiesis has been influential in many areas of theoretical biology, especially in the fields of artificial life and origins of life. However, it has not managed to productively connect with mainstream biology, partly for theoretical reasons, but arguably mainly because deriving specific working hypotheses has been challenging. The theory has recently undergone significant conceptual development in the enactive approach to life and mind. Hidden complexity in the original conception of autopoiesis has been explicated in the service of other operationalizable concepts related to self-individuation: precariousness, adaptivity, and agency. Here we advance these developments by highlighting the interplay of these concepts with considerations from thermodynamics: reversibility, irreversibility, and path-dependence. We interpret this interplay in terms of the self-optimization model, and present modeling results that illustrate how these minimal conditions enable a system to re-organize itself such that it tends toward coordinated constraint satisfaction at the system level. Although the model is still very abstract, these results point in a direction where the enactive approach could productively connect with cell biology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

An unresolved challenge in machine learning is that several of these algorithms get distracted by reward-independent stochastic stimuli. Here, we ask whether humans get distracted by the same stimuli as the algorithms. We design an experimental paradigm where human participants search for rewarding states in an environment with a highly {\textquoteleft}stochastic{\textquoteright} but reward-free sub-region. We show that (i) participants get repeatedly and persistently distracted by novelty in the stochastic part of the environment; (ii) optimism about the availability of other rewards increases this distraction; and (iii) the observed distraction pattern is consistent with the predictions of algorithms driven by novelty but not with {\textquoteleft}optimal{\textquoteright} algorithms driven by information-gain.

	abstract = {According to predictive processing theories of perception, the brain generates predictions to prepare for sensory input, and calibrates certainty of predictions based on their likelihood. When an input doesn{\textquoteright}t match the prediction, an error signal leads to updating of the predictive model. Prior research suggests altered prediction certainty in autism, but predictive processing occurs across the cortical hierarchy, and the stage(s) of processing where prediction certainty breaks down is unknown. We therefore tested the integrity of prediction certainty in autism at pre-attentive and relatively automatic processing stages using the pre-attentive Mismatch Negativity (MMN) brain response. The MMN occurs in response to a {\textquotedblleft}deviant{\textquotedblright} presented in a stream of {\textquotedblleft}standards{\textquotedblright} and is measured while the participant performs an orthogonal task. Most critically, MMN amplitude typically varies with the level of certainty associated with the prediction. We recorded high-density EEG while presenting adolescents and young adults with and without autism with repetitive tones every half second (the standard) interspersed with infrequent pitch and inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) deviants. Pitch and ISI deviant probabilities were manipulated at 4, 8, or 16\% within a block of trials to test whether MMN amplitude varied in a typical manner with respect to probability. For both groups, Pitch-MMN amplitude increased as the probability of deviance decreased. Unexpectedly, ISI-MMN amplitude did not reliably vary by probability in either group. Our Pitch-MMN findings suggest intact neural representation of pre-attentive prediction certainty in autism, addressing a critical knowledge gap in autism research. The implications of these findings are considered.LAY SUMMARY Our brains are always trying to predict what will happen next. For example, when you open your utensil drawer, it would be surprising to see books because your brain expected to see utensils. In our study, we looked at whether the brains of autistic individuals automatically and accurately recognize when something unexpected happens. Results showed similar brain patterns in individuals with and without autism, suggesting that responses to prediction violations are generated in a typical manner during early cortical information processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The classic view that neural populations in sensory cortices preferentially encode responses to incoming stimuli has been strongly challenged by recent experimental studies. Despite the fact that a large fraction of variance of visual responses in rodents can be attributed to behavioral state and movements, trial-history, and salience, the effects of contextual modulations and expectations on sensory-evoked responses in visual and association areas remain elusive. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study showing that hierarchically connected visual and association areas differentially encode the temporal context and expectation of naturalistic visual stimuli, consistent with the theory of hierarchical predictive coding. We measured neural responses to expected and unexpected sequences of natural scenes in the primary visual cortex (V1), the posterior medial higher order visual area (PM), and retrosplenial cortex (RSP) using 2-photon imaging in behaving mice collected through the Allen Institute Mindscope{\textquoteright}s OpenScope program. We found that information about image identity in neural population activity depended on the temporal context of transitions preceding each scene, and decreased along the hierarchy. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the conjunctive encoding of temporal context and image identity was modulated by expectations of sequential events. In V1 and PM, we found enhanced and specific responses to unexpected oddball images, signaling stimulus-specific expectation violation. In contrast, in RSP the population response to oddball presentation recapitulated the missing expected image rather than the oddball image. These differential responses along the hierarchy are consistent with classic theories of hierarchical predictive coding whereby higher areas encode predictions and lower areas encode deviations from expectation. We further found evidence for drift in visual responses on the timescale of minutes. Although activity drift was present in all areas, population responses in V1 and PM, but not in RSP, maintained stable encoding of visual information and representational geometry. Instead we found that RSP drift was independent of stimulus information, suggesting a role in generating an internal model of the environment in the temporal domain. Overall, our results establish temporal context and expectation as substantial encoding dimensions in the visual cortex subject to fast representational drift and suggest that hierarchically connected areas instantiate a predictive coding mechanism.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Satisfying a variety of conflicting needs in a changing environment is a fundamental challenge for any adaptive agent. Here, we show that designing an agent in a modular fashion as a collection of subagents, each dedicated to a separate need, powerfully enhanced the agent{\textquoteright}s capacity to satisfy its overall needs. We used the formalism of deep reinforcement learning to investigate a biologically relevant multi-objective task: continually maintaining homeostasis of a set of physiologic variables. We then conducted simulations in a variety of environments and compared how modular agents performed relative to standard monolithic agents (i.e., agents that aimed to satisfy all needs in an integrated manner using a single aggregate measure of success). Simulations revealed that modular agents: a) exhibited a form of exploration that was intrinsic and emergent rather than extrinsically imposed; b) were robust to changes in non-stationary environments, and c) scaled gracefully in their ability to maintain home-ostasis as the number of conflicting objectives increased. Supporting analysis suggested that the robustness to changing environments and increasing numbers of needs were due to intrinsic exploration and efficiency of representation afforded by the modular architecture. These results suggest that the normative principles by which agents have adapted to complex changing environments may also explain why humans have long been described as consisting of {\textquoteleft}multiple selves{\textquoteright}.Significance Statement Adaptive agents must continually satisfy a range of distinct and possibly conflicting needs. In most models of learning, a monolithic agent tries to maximize one value that measures how well it balances its needs. However, this task is difficult when the world is changing and needs are many. Here, we considered an agent as a collection of modules each dedicated to a particular need and competing for control of action. Compared to the standard monolithic approach, modular agents were much better at maintaining homeostasis of a set of internal variables in simulated environments, both static and changing. These results suggest that having {\textquoteleft}multiple selves{\textquoteright} may represent an evolved solution to the universal problem of balancing multiple needs in changing environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Despite their immense success as a model of macaque visual cortex, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have struggled to predict activity in visual cortex of the mouse, which is thought to be strongly dependent on the animal{\textquoteright}s behavioral state. Furthermore, most computational models focus on predicting neural responses to static images presented under head fixation, which are dramatically different from the dynamic, continuous visual stimuli that arise during movement in the real world. Consequently, it is still unknown how natural visual input and different behavioral variables may integrate over time to generate responses in primary visual cortex (V1). To address this, we introduce a multimodal recurrent neural network that integrates gaze-contingent visual input with behavioral and temporal dynamics to explain V1 activity in freely moving mice. We show that the model achieves state-of-the-art predictions of V1 activity during free exploration and demonstrate the importance of each component in an extensive ablation study. Analyzing our model using maximally activating stimuli and saliency maps, we reveal new insights into cortical function, including the prevalence of mixed selectivity for behavioral variables in mouse V1. In summary, our model offers a comprehensive deep-learning framework for exploring the computational principles underlying V1 neurons in freely-moving animals engaged in natural behavior.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Yet, computational accounts mostly study these processes in isolation. The current study extended standard hybrid models of a widely-used sequential RL-task (two-step task; TST) employed to measure MB control. We implemented and compared different computational model extensions for this task to quantify potential exploration mechanisms. In two independent data sets spanning two different variants of the task, an extension of a classical hybrid RL model with a heuristic-based exploration mechanism provided the best fit, and revealed a robust positive effect of directed exploration on choice probabilities in stage one of the task. Posterior predictive checks further showed that the extended model reproduced choice patterns present in both data sets.

Moreover, to better understand the basis and the impact of anticipatory behaviour, we also measured children{\textquoteright}s ability to understand the dialogue content, their speech perception and memory skills as well as their rhythmic skills. Importantly, we compared children with CI performances with those of an age-matched group of children with NH. While children with CI revealed poorer speech perception and verbal working memory abilities than NH children, there was no difference in gaze anticipatory behaviour. Interestingly, in children with CI only, we found a significant correlation between dialogue comprehension, perceptive skills and gaze anticipatory behaviour. Our results confirm and extend to a conversational context previous findings showing an absence of predictive deficits in children with CI. The current design seems an interesting avenue to provide an accurate and objective estimate of anticipatory language behaviour in a rather ecological conversational context also with young children.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Thus it is important to understand in depth the neuro-computational functions underpinning mentalizing and social reward. We hypothesized that people quickly infer whether other{\textquoteright}s motives are likely beneficial or detrimental, then refine their judgment. Such {\textquoteleft}Classify-refine{\textquoteright}, active inference models of mentalizing motives might improve on traditional models, and hence allow testing the hypothesis that serotonergic antidepressant drugs improve function partly by inducing more benign views of others. In a week-long, placebo vs. Citalopram study using an iterated dictator task, {\textquoteleft}Classify-refine{\textquoteright} models accounted for behaviour better than traditional models. Citalopram did not lead to more magnanimous attributions of motives, but we found evidence that it may help refine attributions about others{\textquoteright} motives through learning. With respect to social differences, model comparison clearly indicated that ethnicity-dependent, in-task biases played no role in attributing motives for the large majority of participants. This is a very encouraging result which further research should seek to replicate, and, if replicated, celebrate. Lower subjective socio-economic status was associated with lower attributions of harm intent to others. We discuss how classify-refine social cognition may be highly adaptive. Future research should examine the role of Serotonergic antidepressants in clinical studies over longer time spans.Significance Statement We developed computational models to study how, in social situations, first impressions count a lot, but people also gradually refine their views to do justice to others. In our study, such {\textquoteleft}classify-refine{\textquoteright} models clearly outperformed the ones based on simpler learning. Modeling analyses indicated that refining one{\textquoteright}s views was facilitated by serotonergic antidepressants. We expected that those who perceived themselves as socially disadvantaged, and those interacting with people of color, would tend to attribute less benign motives to others. However in our low income, highly educated, young sample, we found evidence against both these biases.

Of particular interest are interoceptive learning processes that capture associations between environmental cues and body signals as a basis for making homeostatically relevant predictions about the future. Here we extended an interoceptive Breathing Learning Task (BLT) to incorporate continuous measures of prediction certainty, and tested its application using a Rescorla Wagner (RW) associative learning model. Sixteen healthy participants completed the continuous version of the BLT, where they were asked to predict the likelihood of breathing resistances. The task was modified from a previous version and required continuous, rather than binary predictions, in order to include a more precise measure of prediction certainty. The RW model was used to fit a learning rate to each participant{\textquoteright}s continuous and binarised predictions, and was additionally extended to test whether learning rates differed according to stimuli valence. The empirical task data demonstrated excellent replicability compared to previously collected data using binary predictions, and the continuous model fits closely captured participant behaviour at the group level. The model extension to estimate different learning rates for negative (i.e. breathing resistance) and positive (i.e. no breathing resistance) trials indicated that learning rates did not significantly differ according to stimuli nature. Furthermore, examining the relationship between estimates of prediction certainty and learning rates with interoceptive and mental health questionnaires demonstrated that fatigue severity was related to both prediction certainty and learning rate, and anxiety sensitivity was related to prediction certainty. The updated task and model show promise for future investigations into interoceptive learning and potential links to mental health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Using a two-step task for mice, we show that dopamine reports RPEs using value information inferred from task structure knowledge, alongside information about recent reward rate and movement. Nonetheless, although rewards strongly influenced choices and dopamine, neither activating nor inhibiting dopamine neurons at trial outcome affected future choice. These data were recapitulated by a neural network model in which frontal cortex learned to track hidden task states by predicting observations, while basal ganglia learned corresponding values and actions via dopaminergic RPEs.

	abstract = {Recalling a specific past episode that will enable us to decide which action is suited to a given present situation is a core element of everyday life. A wealth of research has demonstrated that such selective remembering is dependent upon a capacity to inhibit or provisionally {\textquoteleft}forget{\textquoteright} related yet inappropriate memory episodes which could orient behavior in unwilled directions. Everyday-like memory (EdM) refers to this type of common organizational mnemonic capacity, known to deteriorate significantly with age, putatively as a result of decline in the cognitive capacity for selective inhibition or {\textquoteleft}active forgetting{\textquoteright}. Moreover, this memory retrieval-concomitant active forgetting comes at the cost of genuine amnesic weakening of the inhibited episodes, a phenomenon referred to as retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF). In the present study, we introduce a novel characterization of our previously validated mouse model of EdM in terms of the existing active forgetting and RIF literature. We also introduce novel behavioral analyses of the deliberation processes elicited by EdM challenge and use detailed multi-factorial explorations to reveal how these processes are impacted by age, temporal retention demand, difficulty of EdM challenge, and anticipation of trial outcome. Our observations indicate that deliberation requires remembering while accurate anticipation{\textemdash}in which a critical age-related deficit is also observed{\textemdash}requires active forgetting. Our results represent a significant advance towards unifying our understanding of the neurocognitive processes underpinning everyday-like memory, RIF, mnemonic deliberation, anticipatory function, and how they all are impacted by the physiological ageing process. In parallel, we present preliminary results using a transgenic mouse model which point to a fundamental role for the endocannabinoid system (eCS) in active forgetting and EdM, thereby demonstrating that deeper investigation of previously characterized age-related decline of the eCS should be a pre-clinical priority with a view to developing treatments for age-related decline of EdM function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Cerebellar computations are necessary for fine behavioural control and are thought to rely on internal probabilistic models performing state estimation. We propose that the cerebellum infers how states contextualise (i.e., interact with) each other, and coordinates extra-cerebellar neuronal dynamics underpinning a range of behaviours. To support this claim, we describe a cerebellar model for state estimation that includes states interactions, and link the underlying inference with the neuronal architecture and dynamics observed empirically. This is formalised using the free energy principle, which provides a dual perspective on a system in terms of both the dynamics of its physical {\textendash} in this case neuronal {\textendash} states, and the inference process they entail. As a proof of principle, we simulate cerebellar-dependent synchronisation of whisking and respiration, which are known to be tightly coupled in rodents. In summary, we suggest that cerebellar-dependent contextualisation of behaviour can explain its ubiquitous involvement in most aspects of behaviour.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Network representation has been a groundbreaking concept for understanding the behavior of complex systems in social sciences, biology, neuroscience, and beyond. Network science is mathematically founded on graph theory, where nodal importance is gauged using measures of centrality. Notably, recent work suggests that the topological centrality of a node should not be over-interpreted as its dynamical or causal importance in the network. Hence, identifying the influential nodes in dynamic causal models (DCM) remains an open question. This paper introduces causal centrality for DCM, a dynamics-sensitive and causally-founded centrality measure based on the notion of intervention in graphical models. Operationally, this measure simplifies to an identifiable expression using Bayesian model reduction. As a proof of concept, the average DCM of the extended default mode network (eDMN) was computed in 74 healthy subjects. Next, causal centralities of different regions were computed for this causal graph, and compared against major graph-theoretical centralities. The results showed that the subcortical structures of the eDMN are more causally central than the cortical regions, even though the (dynamics-free) graph-theoretical centralities unanimously favor the latter. Importantly, model comparison revealed that only the pattern of causal centrality was causally relevant. These results are consistent with the crucial role of the subcortical structures in the neuromodulatory systems of the brain, and highlight their contribution to the organization of large-scale networks. Potential applications of causal centrality - to study other neurotypical and pathological functional networks {\textendash} are discussed, and some future lines of research are outlined.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Sustained attention, the ability to focus on an activity or stimulus over time, is significantly impaired in many psychiatric disorders, and there remains a major unmet need in treating impaired attention. Continuous performance tests (CPTs) were developed to measure sustained attention in humans, non-human primates, rats, and mice, and similar neural circuits are engaged across species during CPT performance, supporting their use in translational studies to identify novel therapeutics. Here, we identified electrophysiological correlates of attentional performance in a touchscreen-based rodent CPT (rCPT) in the locus coeruleus (LC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), two inter-connected regions that are implicated in attentional processes. We used viral labeling and molecular techniques to demonstrate that neural activity is recruited in LC-ACC projections during the rCPT, and that this recruitment increases with cognitive demand. We implanted male mice with depth electrodes within the LC and ACC for local field potential (LFP) recordings during rCPT training, and identified an increase in ACC delta and theta power, and an increase in LC delta power during correct responses in the rCPT. We also found that the LC leads the ACC in theta frequencies during correct responses while the ACC leads the LC in gamma frequencies during incorrect responses. These findings may represent translational biomarkers that can be used to screen novel therapeutics for drug discovery in attention.Competing Interest StatementGVC is a scientific advisor for LongTermGevity, Inc. and owns stock options in the company.

	abstract = {Numerous studies have found that the Bayesian framework, which formulates the optimal integration of the knowledge of the world (i.e. prior) and current sensory evidence (i.e. likelihood), captures human behaviours sufficiently well. However, there are debates regarding whether humans use precise but cognitively demanding Bayesian computations for behaviours. Across two studies, we trained participants to estimate hidden locations of a target drawn from priors with different levels of uncertainty. In each trial, scattered dots provided noisy likelihood information about the target location. Participants showed that they learned the priors and combined prior and likelihood information to infer target locations in a Bayes fashion. We then introduced a transfer condition presenting a trained prior and a likelihood that has never been put together during training. How well participants integrate this novel likelihood with their learned prior is an indicator of whether participants perform Bayesian computations. In one study, participants experienced the newly introduced likelihood, which was paired with a different prior, during training. Participants changed likelihood weighting following expected directions although the degrees of change were significantly lower than Bayes-optimal predictions. In another group, the novel likelihoods were never used during training. We found people integrated a new likelihood within (interpolation) better than the one outside (extrapolation) the range of their previous learning experience and they were quantitatively Bayes-suboptimal in both. We replicated the findings of both studies in a validation dataset. Our results showed that Bayesian behaviours may not always be achieved by a full Bayesian computation. Future studies can apply our approach to different tasks to enhance the understanding of decision-making mechanisms.Author summary Bayesian decision theory has emerged as a unified approach for capturing a wide range of behaviours under uncertainty. However, behavioural evidence supporting that humans use explicit Bayesian computation is scarce. While it has been argued that knowledge generalization should be treated as hard evidence of the use of Bayesian strategies, results from previous work were inconclusive. Here, we develop a marker that effectively quantifies how well humans transfer learned priors to a new scenario. Our marker can be applied to various tasks and thus can provide a path forwarding the understanding of psychological and biological underpinnings of inferential behaviours.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Speech production is known to engage a distributed network. The brain regions responsible for the initiation of articulation are unclear, and they would be expected to coordinate a distributed network. Using direct intracranial recordings in a large cohort, during stereotyped speech production to eliminate confounds of phonological and semantic complexity, we performed a comprehensive analysis of cortical sites engaged in speech initiation. We found that the supplementary motor area (SMA) was the earliest speech motor region to be active prior to speech onset and was active almost exclusively prior to articulation. Broadband gamma activity in the SMA was predictive of the response time of word production, predicting response time from 250 ms after stimulus onset. Neural activity in SMA began at a highly predictable time after stimulus onset and extended until speech onset. SMA activity offset coincided with ventral premotor cortex and primary motor activity onset. This suggests that the SMA may coordinate the concerted activation of motor execution cortex. Our results support the idea that SMA is a key node in the speech initiation network.Significance statement Producing speech requires coordination across multiple brain regions. One cortical region - the supplementary motor area (SMA) - has long been a candidate region to coordinate across other regions to initiate speech production. In this study, we used human intracranial recordings from patients with epilepsy to investigate the role of the SMA in initiating speech. In a picture-naming task, subjects repeated the word {\textquotedblleft}scrambled{\textquotedblright} scores of times; using this condition to eliminate any linguistic confounds, we found that the SMA was consistently one of the earliest regions to activate during word production. We also uncovered the SMA{\textquoteright}s temporally precise tuning to speech onset at the single-trial level.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Yet currently there is no behavioral model of short-term priming in lab animals, limiting the study of the neurobiological basis of priming. Here, we describe an auditory discrimination paradigm for studying response priming in freely-moving mice. We find a priming effect in success rate in all mice tested on the task. In contrast to humans, we do not find a priming effect in response times. Compared to non-primed discrimination trials, the addition of incongruent prime stimuli reduces success rate more than congruent prime stimuli, suggesting a cognitive mechanism based on differential interference. The results establish the short-term priming phenomenon in rodents, and the paradigm opens the door to studying the cellular-network basis of priming.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Rational decision making is grounded in learning to associate actions with outcomes, a process that depends on projections from prefrontal cortex to dorsomedial striatum. Symptoms associated with a variety of human pathological conditions ranging from schizophrenia and autism to Huntington{\textquoteright}s and Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease point toward functional deficits in this projection, but its development is not well understood, making it difficult to investigate how perturbations in development of this circuitry could contribute to pathophysiology. We applied a novel strategy based on Hotspot Analysis to assess the developmental progression of anatomical positioning of prefrontal cortex to striatal projections. Corticostriatal axonal territories established at P7 expand in concert with striatal growth but remain largely unchanged in positioning through adulthood, indicating they are generated by directed, targeted growth and not modified extensively by postnatal experience. Consistent with these findings, corticostriatal synaptogenesis increased steadily from P7 to P56, with no evidence for widescale pruning. As corticostriatal synapse density increased over late postnatal ages, the strength of evoked PFC input onto dorsomedial striatal projection neurons also increased, but spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic activity was stable. Based on its pattern of expression, we asked whether the adhesion protein, Cdh8, influenced this progression. In mice lacking Cdh8 in PFC corticostriatal projection neurons, axon terminal fields in dorsal striatum shifted ventrally. Corticostriatal synaptogenesis was unimpeded, but spontaneous EPSC frequency declined and mice failed to learn to associate an action with an outcome. Collectively these findings show that corticostriatal axons grow to their target zone and are restrained from an early age, do not undergo postnatal synapse pruning as the most dominant models predict, and that a relatively modest shift in terminal arbor positioning and synapse function has an outsized, negative impact on corticostriatal-dependent behavior.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The pleasurable urge to move to music (PLUMM) elicits activity in motor and reward areas of the brain and is thought to be driven by predictive processes. Dopamine within motor and limbic cortico-striatal networks is implicated in the predictive processes underlying beat-based timing and music-induced pleasure, respectively. This suggests a central role of cortico-striatal dopamine in PLUMM. This study tested this hypothesis by comparing PLUMM in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease patients, healthy age-matched, and young controls. Participants listened to musical sequences with varying rhythmic and harmonic complexity (low, medium, high), and rated their experienced pleasure and urge to move to the rhythm. In line with previous results, healthy younger participants showed an inverted U-shaped relation between rhythmic complexity and ratings, with a preference for medium complexity rhythms, while age-matched controls showed a similar, but weaker, inverted U-shaped response. Conversely, PD patients showed a significantly flattened response for both the urge to move and pleasure. Crucially, this flattened response could not be attributed to differences in rhythm discrimination and did not reflect an overall decrease in ratings. Together, these results support the role of dopamine within cortico-striatal networks in the predictive processes that form the link between the perceptual processing of rhythmic patterns, and the affective and motor responses to rhythmic music.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

One of the reasons why the internal milieu of the GI system is poorly investigated is because visceral organs are difficult to access and monitor. To directly measure the influence of endoluminal markers of GI activity on the emotional experience, we asked a group of healthy male participants to ingest a pill that measured pH, pressure, and temperature of their GI tract while they watched video-clips that consistently induced disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or a control neutral state. In addition to the objective physiological markers of GI activity, subjective ratings of perceived emotions and visceral (i.e. gastric, respiratory and cardiac) sensations were recorded. We found that when participants observed fearful and disgusting video-clips, they reported to perceive not only cardiac and respiratory sensations but also gastric sensations, such as nausea. Moreover, we found that there was a clear relation between the physiology of the stomach and the perceived emotions. Specifically, when disgusting video-clips were displayed, the more acidic the pH, the more participants reported feelings of disgust and fear; the less acidic the pH, the more they reported happiness. Our findings suggest that gastric signals contribute to unique emotional states and that ingestible pills may open new avenues for exploring the deep-body physiology of emotions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, how the brain encodes priors into spontaneous activity and utilizes them for inference tasks remains unclear. Here, we present a synaptic plasticity mechanism to generate cell assemblies encoding the statistical structure of salient sensory events and spontaneously replay these assemblies in spiking recurrent neural networks. The plasticity mechanism installs a Hebbian-like learning rule at excitatory and inhibitory synapses to minimize mismatches in the probability structure between stimulus-evoked and internally driven activities.

	abstract = {People coordinate their eye, head, and body movements to gather information from a dynamic environment while maximizing reward and minimizing biomechanical and energetic costs. Such natural behavior is not possible in a laboratory setting where the head and body are usually restrained and the tasks and stimuli used often lack ecological validity. Therefore, it{\textquoteright}s unclear to what extent principles of fixation selection derived from lab studies, such as inhibition-of-return (IOR), apply in a real-world setting. To address this gap, participants performed nine real-world tasks, including driving, grocery shopping, and building a lego set, while wearing a mobile eye tracker (169 recordings; 26.6 hours). Surprisingly, spatial and temporal IOR were absent in all tasks. Instead, participants most often returned to what they just viewed, and saccade latencies were shorter preceding return than forward saccades. We hypothesized that participants minimize the time their eyes spend in an eccentric position to conserve eye and head motor effort. Correspondingly, we observed center biases in the distributions of fixation location and duration, relative to the head{\textquoteright}s orientation. A model that generates scanpaths by randomly sampling these distributions reproduced the spatial and temporal return phenomena seen in the data, including distinct 3-fixation sequences for forward versus return saccades. The amount of the orbit used in each task traded off with fixation duration, as if both incur costs in the same space. Conservation of effort ({\textquotedblleft}laziness{\textquotedblright}) explains all these behaviors, demonstrating that motor costs shape how people extract and act on relevant visual information from the environment.Significance Statement Humans display remarkably precise yet flexible control of eye and body movements, allowing for a wide range of activities. However, most studies of gaze behavior use the same setup: a head-restrained participant views small images on a computer. Such lab studies find that people avoid looking at the same thing twice, and hesitate in cases when they do. We had people perform nine everyday activities while wearing glasses with embedded eye tracking, and surprisingly found that they did the opposite, often returning to what they just viewed and expediting these {\textquotedblleft}return{\textquotedblright} eye movements over others. A tendency to keep the eyes centered in the head, which we speculate helps to conserve motor effort, explained these behaviors for all tasks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors are affiliated with Reality Lab Research, Meta Platforms Inc., though this study did not include any products or services related to the company.

	abstract = {The mirror neurons network in the human brain is activated both during the observation of action and the execution of the same action, facilitating thus the transformation of visual information into motor representations, to understand the actions and intentions of others. How this transformation takes place, however, is still under debate. One prevailing theory, direct matching, assumes a direct correspondence between the visual information of the actor{\textquoteright}s movement and the activation of the motor representations in the observer{\textquoteright}s motor cortex that would produce the same movement. Alternatively, the predictive coding theory postulates that, during action observation, motor predictions (e.g., position, velocity) are generated and compared to the visual information of the actor{\textquoteright}s movement. Here, we experimentally interrogate these two hypotheses during a locomotion task. The motor prediction process was assessed by measuring the timing of imagined movements: the participants had to imagine walking, forward or backward, for 9 m (linear path). Action observation was assessed by measuring time estimation in an inference locomotor task (the same 9 m linear path): after perceiving an actor walking forward or backward for 3 m, the vision of the observer was occluded and he/she had to estimate when the actor would reach the end of the 9 m path. We manipulated the timing processes during the two tasks by creating sensory illusions via peripheral mechanical muscle vibration on leg muscles, which has provided consistent results in the literature (acceleration of forward and deceleration of backward locomotion). We found that sensory illusions specifically affected the timing processes of both locomotion inference and mental locomotion, suggesting the involvement of sensorimotor predictions, common to both tasks. These findings seem to support the predictive coding hypothesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we infer an energy-based model of the ARTR, a circuit that controls zebrafish swimming statistics, using functional recordings of the spontaneous activity of hundreds of neurons. Although our model is trained to reproduce the low-order statistics of the network activity at short time-scales, its simulated dynamics quantitatively captures the slowly alternating activity of the ARTR. It further reproduces the modulation of this persistent dynamics by the water temperature and visual stimulation. Mathematical analysis of the model unveils a low-dimensional landscape-based representation of the ARTR activity, where the slow network dynamics reflects Arrhenius-like barriers crossings between metastable states. Our work thus shows how data-driven models built from large neural populations recordings can be reduced to low-dimensional functional models in order to reveal the fundamental mechanisms controlling the collective neuronal dynamics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {We examined the neural signature of directed exploration by contrasting MEG beta (16-30 Hz) power changes between disadvantageous and advantageous choices in the two-choice probabilistic reward task. We analyzed the choices made after the participants have learned the probabilistic contingency between choices and their outcomes, i.e., acquired the inner model of choice values. Therefore, rare disadvantageous choices might serve explorative, environment-probing purposes. The study brought two main findings. Firstly, decision making leading to disadvantageous choices took more time and evidenced greater large-scale suppression of beta oscillations than its advantageous alternative. Additional neural resources recruited during disadvantageous decisions strongly suggest their deliberately explorative nature. Secondly, an outcome of disadvantageous and advantageous choices had qualitatively different impact on feedback-related beta oscillations. After the disadvantageous choices, only losses {\textendash} but not gains {\textendash} were followed by late beta synchronization in frontal cortex. Our results are consistent with the role of frontal beta oscillations in the stabilization of neural representations for selected behavioral rule when explorative strategy conflicts with value-based behavior. Punishment for explorative choice being congruent with its low value in the reward history is more likely to strengthen, through punishment-related beta oscillations, the representation of exploitative choices consistent with the inner utility model.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The sparse nature of single-cell omics data makes it challenging to dissect the wiring and rewiring of the transcriptional and signaling drivers that regulate cellular states. Many of the drivers, referred to as {\textquotedblleft}hidden drivers{\textquotedblright}, are difficult to identify via conventional expression analysis due to low expression and inconsistency between RNA and protein activity caused by post-translational and other modifications. To address this issue, we developed scMINER, a mutual information (MI)-based computational framework for unsupervised clustering analysis and cell-type specific inference of intracellular networks, hidden drivers and network rewiring from single-cell RNA-seq data. We designed scMINER to capture nonlinear cell-cell and gene-gene relationships and infer driver activities. Systematic benchmarking showed that scMINER outperforms popular single-cell clustering algorithms, especially in distinguishing similar cell types. With respect to network inference, scMINER does not rely on the binding motifs which are available for a limited set of transcription factors, therefore scMINER can provide quantitative activity assessment for more than 6,000 transcription and signaling drivers from a scRNA-seq experiment. As demonstrations, we used scMINER to expose hidden transcription and signaling drivers and dissect their regulon rewiring in immune cell heterogeneity, lineage differentiation, and tissue specification. Overall, activity-based scMINER is a widely applicable, highly accurate, reproducible and scalable method for inferring cellular transcriptional and signaling networks in each cell state from scRNA-seq data.

	abstract = {Animals can discriminate myriad sensory stimuli but can also generalize from learned experience. You can probably distinguish the favorite teas of your colleagues while still recognizing that all tea pales in comparison to coffee. Tradeoffs between detection, discrimination, and generalization are inherent at every layer of sensory processing. During development, specific quantitative parameters are wired into perceptual circuits and set the playing field on which plasticity mechanisms play out. A primary goal of systems neuroscience is to understand how material properties of a circuit define the logical operations{\textemdash} computations--that it makes, and what good these computations are for survival. A cardinal method in biology{\textemdash}and the mechanism of evolution--is to change a unit or variable within a system and ask how this affects organismal function. Here, we make use of our knowledge of developmental wiring mechanisms to modify hard-wired circuit parameters in the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body and assess the functional and behavioral consequences. By altering the number of expansion layer neurons (Kenyon cells) and their dendritic complexity, we find that input number, but not cell number, tunes odor selectivity. Simple odor discrimination performance is maintained when Kenyon cell number is reduced and augmented by Kenyon cell expansion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {We propose that the neocortex implements active predictive coding (APC), a form of predictive coding that incorporates hierarchical dynamics and actions. In this model, each neocortical area estimates both sensory states and actions, and the cortex as whole learns to predict the sensory consequences of actions at multiple hierarchical levels. {\textquotedblleft}Higher{\textquotedblright} cortical areas maintain more abstract representations at larger spatiotemporal scales compared to {\textquotedblleft}lower{\textquotedblright} areas. Feedback from higher areas modulate the dynamics of both state and action networks in lower areas. This allows the cortical network to model the complex dynamics and physics of the world in terms of simpler compositional elements (state transition functions). Simultaneously, current higher level goals invoke sequences of lower level sub-goals and actions, allowing the network to solve complex planning problems by composing simpler solutions. Planning ({\textquotedblleft}system 2{\textquotedblright} thinking) in turns allows the network to learn, over time, perception-to-action mappings (policies; {\textquotedblleft}system 1{\textquotedblright} thinking) at multiple abstraction levels. We provide examples from simulations illustrating how the same APC architecture can solve problems that, at first blush, seem very different from each other: (1) how do we recognize an object and its parts using eye movements? (2) why does perception seem stable despite eye movements? (3) how do we learn compositional representations, e.g., part-whole hierarchies, and nested reference frames for equivariant vision? (4) how do we model the {\textquotedblleft}physics{\textquotedblright} of a complex environment by decomposing it into simpler components? (5) how do we plan actions in a complex domain to achieve a goal by composing sequences of sub-goals and simpler actions? and (6) how do we form episodic memories of sensory-motor experiences? We propose a mapping of the APC network to the laminar architecture of the cortex and suggest possible roles for cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic, cortico-hippocampal and cortico-subcortical pathways.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

By spiking-in heavy stable isotope labeled phosphopeptide standards covering seven major signaling pathways, we benchmarked hybrid-DIA against state-of-the-art targeted MS methods (i.e. SureQuant) using EGF-stimulated HeLa cells and found the quantitative accuracy and sensitivity to be comparable while hybrid-DIA also profiled the global phosphoproteome. To demonstrate the robustness, sensitivity and potential of hybrid-DIA, we profiled chemotherapeutic agents in single colon carcinoma multicellular spheroids and evaluated the difference of cancer cells in 2D vs 3D culture. Altogether, we showed that hybrid-DIA is the way-to-go method in highly sensitive phospho-proteomics experiments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors declare the following competing financial interest(s): K.L.F., Y.X, T.M. and A.A.M. are employees of Thermo Fisher Scientific, the manufacturer of the Orbitrap Exploris 480 MS instrument used in this research.},

	abstract = {The brain is the most complex organ in mammals and understanding the origin of this complexity is a major challenge for developmental biologists. Crucial to the size and morphology of the cortex is the timing and transition of neural stem cell (NSC) fate. An interesting candidate for modulating and fine tuning these processes is the transcriptional regulator Ski, a protooncogene expressed in cortical cells. Ski is involved in diverse cellular processes and epigenetic programs, and mice deficient in Ski exhibit complex central nervous system defects that resemble some of the features observed in patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome and Shprintzen{\textendash}Goldberg syndrome. Here, we took advantage of in vivo transgenic labeling and next-generation sequencing to analyze the gene expression profiles of NSCs, basal progenitor (BP) cells, and newborn neurons (NBNs) from wildtype and Ski-deficient embryos throughout cortical development. We created a unique database that allowed us to identify and compare signaling pathways and transcriptional networks within each progenitor population in the presence and absence of Ski. We find that NSCs are the most affected cell population and uncover that mutant NSCs fail to switch to a gliogenic fate in time. We show that Ski functions in concert with the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway to alter the cell differentiation fate of NSCs from neurons to glia, which is key to generating adequate numbers of specific cell types during corticogenesis. Thus, by combining genetic tools and bioinformatic analysis, our work not only deepens the knowledge of how Ski functions in the brain, but also provides an immense resource for studying neurodevelopmental disorders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In the perceptual and sensorimotor domains, ageing is accompanied by a stronger reliance on top-down predictive model information and reduced sensory learning, thus promoting simpler, more efficient internal models in older adults. Here, we demonstrate analogous effects in higher-order language processing. One-hundred and twenty adults ranging in age from 18 to 83 years listened to short auditory passages containing manipulations of adjective order, with order probabilities varying between two speakers. As a measure of model adaptation, we examined attunement of the N400 event-related potential, a measure of precision-weighted prediction errors in language, to a trial-by-trial measure of speaker-based adjective order expectedness ({\textquotedblleft}speaker-based surprisal{\textquotedblright}) across the course of the experiment. Adaptation was strongest for young adults, weaker for middle-aged adults, and absent for older adults. Over and above age-related differences, we observed individual differences in model adaptation, with aperiodic (1/f) slope and intercept metrics derived from resting-state EEG showing the most pronounced modulations. We suggest that age-related changes in aperiodic slope, which have been linked to neural noise, may be associated with individual differences in the magnitude of stimulus-related prediction error signals. By contrast, changes in aperiodic intercept, which reflects aggregate population spiking, may relate to an individual{\textquoteright}s updating of inferences regarding stimulus precision. These two mechanisms jointly contribute to age-related changes in the precision-weighting of prediction errors and the degree of sensory learning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Given relatively large sensorimotor delays, during social interactions, predicting the behavior of others is crucial to enable joint actions or provide competitive advantages. The action observation network (AON) has been extensively studied, but how information is integrated across its main nodes remains poorly understood. Here we leverage the high spatial and temporal resolution of intracranial Electrocorticography (ECoG), to characterize how the key nodes of the AON - including precentral, supramarginal and visual areas - exchange information. We found more top-down beta oscillation from precentral to supramarginal contacts during the observation of predictable actions while more bottom-up gamma oscillation from visual to supramarginal contacts were measured for unpredictable actions. These results, in line with predictive coding, provide critical evidence towards an understanding of how nodes of the AON integrate information to process the actions of others.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The human brain scaffolds social cognitive functions, including Theory of Mind, empathy and compassion, through its functional and microstructural organization. However, it remains unclear how the learning and refinement of these skills may, in turn, shape brain function and structure. Here we studied if different types of social mental training can lead to plastic changes in brain function and microstructure. We studied a group of 332 healthy adults (197 women, 20-55 years) with repeated multimodal neuroimaging and behavioral testing. Our neuroimaging approach capitalized on the quantification of cortical functional gradients and myelin-sensitive T1 relaxometry, two emerging measures of cortical functional organization and microstructure. Longitudinal analysis indicated marked changes in intrinsic cortical function and microstructure, which varied as a function of social training content. In particular, we observed consistent differential change in function and microstructure between attention-mindfulness and socio-cognitive training in regions functionally associated with attention and interoception, including insular and parietal cortices. Conversely, socio-affective and socio-cognitive training resulted in differential microstructural changes in regions classically implicated in interoceptive and emotional processing, including insular and orbitofrontal areas, but did not result in functional reorganization. Notably, longitudinal changes in cortical function and microstructure were predictive of behavioral change in attention, compassion and perspective-taking, suggesting behavioral relevance. In sum, our work provides evidence for functional and microstructural plasticity after the training of social-interoceptive functions, and provides a causal perspective on the neural basis of behavioral adaptation in human adults.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex engage in probabilistic coding, effectively encoding the state of the surrounding environment with high accuracy and extraordinary energy efficiency. A new approach models the inherently probabilistic nature of cortical neuron signaling outcomes as a thermodynamic process of non-deterministic computation. A mean field approach is used, with the trial Hamiltonian maximizing free energy and minimizing the net quantity of temperature-entropy, compared with a reference Hamiltonian. Thermodynamic quantities are always conserved during the computation; free energy must be expended to produce information, and free energy is released during information compression, as correlations are identified between the encoding system and its surrounding environment. Due to the relationship between the Gibbs free energy equation and the Nernst equation, any increase in free energy is paired with a local decrease in membrane potential. As a result, this process of thermodynamic computation adjusts the likelihood of each neuron firing an action potential. This model shows that non-deterministic signaling outcomes can be achieved by noisy cortical neurons, through an energy-efficient computational process that involves optimally redistributing a Hamiltonian over some time evolution. Calculations demonstrate that the energy efficiency of the human brain is consistent with this model of non-deterministic computation, with net entropy production far too low to retain the assumptions of a classical system.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Economic efficiency has been a popular explanation for how networks self-organize within the developing nervous system. However, the precise nature of the economic negotiations governing this putative organizational principle remains unclear. Here, we address this question further by combining large-scale electrophysiological recordings, to characterize the functional connectivity of developing neuronal networks in vitro, with a generative modeling approach capable of simulating network formation. We find that the best fitting model uses a homophilic generative wiring principle in which neurons form connections to other neurons which are spatially proximal and have similar connectivity patterns to themselves. Homophilic generative models outperform more canonical models in which neurons wire depending upon their spatial proximity either alone or in combination with the extent of their local connectivity. This homophily-based mechanism for neuronal network emergence accounts for a wide range of observations that are described, but not sufficiently explained, by traditional analyses of network topology. Using rodent and human monolayer and organoid cultures, we show that homophilic generative mechanisms can accurately recapitulate the topology of emerging cellular functional connectivity, representing an important wiring principle and determining factor of neuronal network formation in vitro.Competing Interest StatementSR is employed at MaxWell Biosystems AG, which commercializes HD-MEA technology.},

	abstract = {A topic of growing interest in computational neuroscience is the discovery of fundamental principles underlying global dynamics and the self-organization of the brain. In particular, the notion that the brain operates near criticality has gained considerable support, and recent work has shown that the dynamics of different brain states may be modeled by pairwise maximum entropy Ising models at various distances from a phase transition, i.e., from criticality. Here we aim to characterize two brain states (psychedelics-induced and placebo) as captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with features derived from the Ising spin model formalism (system temperature, critical point, susceptibility) and from algorithmic complexity. We hypothesized, along the lines of the entropic brain hypothesis, that psychedelics drive brain dynamics into a more disordered state at a higher Ising temperature and increased complexity. We analyze resting state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data collected in an earlier study from fifteen subjects in a control condition (placebo) and during ingestion of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Working with the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) brain parcellation, we first create {\textquotedblleft}archetype{\textquotedblright} Ising models representative of the entire dataset (global) and of the data in each condition. Remarkably, we find that such archetypes exhibit a strong correlation with an average structural connectome template obtained from dMRI (r = 0.6). We compare the archetypes from the two conditions and find that the Ising connectivity in the LSD condition is lower than the placebo one, especially at homotopic links (interhemispheric connectivity), reflecting a significant decrease of homotopic functional connectivity in the LSD condition. The global archetype is then personalized for each individual and condition by adjusting the system temperature. The resulting temperatures are all near but above the critical point of the model in the paramagnetic (disordered) phase. The individualized Ising temperatures are higher in the LSD condition than the placebo condition (p = 9 {\texttimes} 10-5). Next, we estimate the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) complexity of the binarized BOLD data and the synthetic data generated with the individualized model using the Metropolis algorithm for each participant and condition. The LZW complexity computed from experimental data reveals a weak statistical relationship with condition (p = 0.04 one-tailed Wilcoxon test) and none with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.13, p = 0.65), presumably because of the limited length of the BOLD time series. Similarly, we explore complexity using the block decomposition method (BDM), a more advanced method for estimating algorithmic complexity. The BDM complexity of the experimental data displays a significant correlation with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.56, p = 0.03) and a weak but significant correlation with condition (p = 0.04, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). This study suggests that the effects of LSD increase the complexity of brain dynamics by loosening interhemispheric connectivity{\textemdash}especially homotopic links. In agreement with earlier work using the Ising formalism with BOLD data, we find the brain state in the placebo condition is already above the critical point, with LSD resulting in a shift further away from criticality into a more disordered state.Author summary In this study, we aim to characterize two brain states (psychedelics-induced and placebo), as captured in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, with features derived from the Ising model formalism (system temperature, critical point, susceptibility) and from algorithmic complexity. Under the hypothesis that psychedelics drive the brain into a more disordered state, we study criticality features of brain dynamics under LSD in a within-subject study using the Ising model formalism and algorithmic complexity using Lempel-Ziv and the Block Decomposition methods. Personalized Ising models are created by first using BOLD fMRI data from all the subjects and conditions to create a single Ising {\textquotedblleft}archetype{\textquotedblright} model{\textemdash}which we can interpret as the average model of the data at unit temperature{\textemdash}and then by adjusting the model temperature for each subject and condition. We find that the effects of LSD translate into increased BOLD signal complexity and Ising temperature, in agreement with earlier findings and predictions from existing theories of the effects of psychedelics, such as the relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS), the anarchic brain hypothesis [1], and the algorithmic information theory of consciousness (KT) [2, 3]. However, in contrast with some of the previously cited theories, we find that the system in the placebo condition is already in the paramagnetic phase{\textemdash}above the critical point{\textemdash}with ingestion of LSD resulting in a shift away from Ising criticality into a more disordered state. Finally, we highlight the fact that the structural connectome can be recovered to a good degree by fitting an Ising model and that the reduction of homotopic links appears to play an important role in the slide to disorder under psychedelics.Competing Interest StatementNeuroelectrics authors work for a company developing novel brain stimulation solutions.

	abstract = {It has long been known that human breathing is altered during listening and speaking compared to rest. Theoretical models of human communication suggest two distinct phenomena during speaking and listening: During speaking, inhalation depth is adjusted to the air volume required for the upcoming utterance. During listening, inhalation is temporally aligned to inhalation of the speaker. While evidence for the former is relatively strong, it is virtually absent for the latter. We address both questions using recordings of speech envelope and respiration in 30 participants during 14 minutes of speaking and listening. We extend existing evidence for the first phenomenon by using the speech envelope to show that inhalation depth is positively correlated with the total power of the speech envelope in the following utterance. Pertaining to the second phenomenon, we provide first evidence that inhalation during listening to your own speech is significantly more likely at time points of inhalation during speaking. These findings are compatible with models that postulate alignment of internal forward models of interlocutors with the aim to facilitate communication.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we study this forward model by using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to comprehensively map connectivity of regional brain activity within the brain and to the speech envelope during continuous speaking and listening. Our results reveal a partly shared neural substrate for both processes but also a dissociation in space, delay and frequency. Neural activity in motor and frontal areas is coupled to succeeding speech in delta band (1-3 Hz), whereas coupling in the theta range follows speech in temporal areas during speaking. Neural connectivity results showed a separation of bottom-up and top-down signalling in distinct frequency bands during speaking. Here, we show that frequency-specific connectivity channels for bottom-up and top-down signalling support continuous speaking and listening in a way that is consistent with the predictive coding framework.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase serotonin activity in the brain. While they are mostly known for their antidepressant properties, they have been shown to improve visual functions in amblyopia and impact cognitive functions ranging from attention to motivation and sensitivity to reward. Yet, a clear understanding of the specific action of serotonin to each of bottom-up sensory and top-down cognitive control components and their interaction is still missing. To address this question, we characterize, in two adult macaques, the behavioral effects of fluoxetine, a specific SSRI, on visual perception under varying bottom-up (luminosity, distractors) and top-down (uncertainty, reward biases) constraints while they are performing three different visual tasks. We first manipulate target luminosity in a visual detection task, and we show that fluoxetine degrades luminance perceptual thresholds. We then use a target detection task in the presence of spatial distractors, and we show that under fluoxetine, monkeys display both more liberal responses as well as a degraded perceptual spatial resolution. In a last target selection task, involving free choice in the presence of reward biases, we show that monkeys display an increased sensitivity to reward outcome under fluoxetine. In addition, we report that monkeys produce, under fluoxetine, more trials and less aborts, increased pupil size, shorter blink durations, as well as task-dependent changes in reaction times. Overall, while low level vision appears to be degraded by fluoxetine, performance in the visual tasks are maintained under fluoxetine due to enhanced top-down control based on task outcome and reward maximization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Methamphetamine use disorder associated with a dysfunctional neural feedback (reward-punishment) processing system and is considered a public health risk. Although several behavioral, computational, and electrocortical studies have explored feedback processing in other groups of individuals, the precise mechanisms of feedback processing dysfunction in methamphetamine use dependent (MUD) individuals remain unclear. Furthermore, our recent knowledge about the underlying feedback-related connectivity patterns and intertwining latent components of behavior with electrocortical signals in MUDs remained quite poor. The present study intended to fill these gaps by exploring the behavioral and electrocortical responses of abstained MUDs during a feedback-based learning paradigm. As mathematical models revealed, MUDs have less sensitivity to distinguishing optimal options (less sensitivity to options value) and learned less from negative feedback, compared with healthy controls. The MUDs also presented smaller medial-frontal theta (5{\textendash}8 Hz) oscillations in response to negative feedback (300-550 ms post feedback) while other measures responsible for learning including, feedback-related negativity (FRN), parietal-P300, and a flux originated from medial frontal to lateral prefrontal remained intact for them. Further, in contrast to healthy controls, the observed association between feedback sensitivity and medial-frontal theta activity is eliminated in MUDs. We suggested that these results in MUDs may be due to the adverse effect of methamphetamine on the cortico-striatal dopamine circuit, reflected in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity as the best candidate region responsible for efficient behavior adjustment. This study unveils the underlying neural mechanism of feedback processing in individuals with methamphetamine use history and could offer individual therapeutic approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Prediction errors are differences between expected and actual sensory input and are thought to be key computational signals that drive learning related plasticity. One way that prediction errors could drive learning is by activating neuromodulatory systems to gate plasticity. The catecholaminergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a major neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice exploring a virtual environment, we found that the activity of LC axons in the cortex correlated with the magnitude of unsigned visuomotor prediction errors. LC response profiles were similar in both motor and visual cortical areas, indicating that LC axons broadcast prediction errors throughout the dorsal cortex. While imaging calcium activity in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex, we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC axons facilitated learning of a stimulus-specific suppression of visual responses during locomotion. This plasticity {\textendash} induced by minutes of LC stimulation {\textendash} recapitulated the effect of visuomotor learning on a scale that is normally observed during visuomotor development across days. We conclude that prediction errors drive LC activity, and that LC activity facilitates sensorimotor plasticity in the cortex, consistent with a role in modulating learning rates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The processing of proprioceptive information in the context of a conflict between visual and somatosensory feedbacks deteriorates motor performance. Previous studies have shown that seeing one{\textquoteright}s hand increases the weighting assigned to arm somatosensory inputs. In this light, we hypothesized that the sensory conflict, when tracing the contour of a shape with mirror-reversed vision, will be greater for participants who trace with a stylus seen in their hand (Hand group, n=17) than for participants who trace with the tip of rod without seen their hand (Tool group, n=15). Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that the tracing performance with mirror vision will be more deteriorated for the Hand group than for the Tool group, and we predicted a greater gating of somatosensory information for the Hand group to reduce the sensory conflict. The participants of both groups followed the outline of a shape in two visual conditions. Direct vision: the participants saw the hand or portion of a light 40 cm rod directly. Mirror Vision: the hand or the rod was seen through a mirror. We measured tracing performance using a digitizing tablet and the cortical activity with electroencephalography. Behavioral analyses revealed that the tracing performance of both groups was similarly impaired by mirror vision. However, contrasting the spectral content of the cortical oscillatory activity between the Mirror and Direct conditions, we observed that tracing with mirror vision resulted in significantly larger alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) powers in the somatosensory cortex for participants of the Hand group. The somatosensory alpha and beta powers did not significantly differ between Mirror and Direct vision conditions for the Tool group. For both groups, tracing with mirror vision altered the activity of the visual cortex: decreased alpha power for the Hand group, decreased alpha and beta power for the Tool group. Overall, these results suggest that seeing the hand enhanced the sensory conflict when tracing with mirror vision and that the increase of alpha and beta powers in the somatosensory cortex served to reduce the weight assigned to somatosensory information. The increased activity of the visual cortex observed for both groups in the mirror vision condition suggests greater visual processing with increased task difficulty. Finally, the fact that the participants of the Tool group did not show better tracing performance than those of the Hand group suggests that tracing deterioration resulted from a sensorimotor conflict (as opposed to a visuo-proprioceptive conflict).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, the cell type-specific and spatially restricted drivers of chronic tissue damage and lesion expansion are not well understood. Here, we investigated the properties of subcortical white matter lesions by creating a cell type-specific spatial map of gene expression across various inflammatory lesion stages in MS. An integrated analysis of single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics data enabled us to uncover patterns of glial, immune and stromal cell subtype diversity, as well as to identify cell-cell communication and signaling signatures across lesion and non-lesion tissue areas in MS. Our results provide insights into the conversion of the tissue microenvironment from a {\textquoteleft}homeostatic{\textquoteright} to a pathogenic or {\textquoteleft}dysfunctional{\textquoteright} state underlying lesion progression in MS. We expect that this study will help identify spatially resolved cell type-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future interventional trials in MS.Competing Interest StatementJ.S.R. reports funding from GSK and Sanofi and fees from Travere Therapeutics and Astex Pharmaceuticals.

In two experiments, we quantitatively assessed how priors inform both decisions and confidence. With a gamified dual-decision task we controlled the strength of priors and likelihoods to create pairs of conditions that were matched in posterior information, but differed on whether the prior or likelihood was more informative. We found that priors were underweighted in discrimination decisions, but used to a greater extent in confidence about those decisions, and this was not due to differences in processing time. With a Bayesian model we quantified the weighting parameters for the prior at both levels, and confirmed that priors are more optimally used in explicit confidence, even when underused in decisions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We simultaneously profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 45,549 cortical nuclei across 6 broad developmental time-points from fetus to adult. We identified cell-type specific domains in which chromatin accessibility is highly correlated with gene expression. Differentiation pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates that chromatin accessibility at cis-regulatory elements precedes transcription and that dynamic changes in chromatin structure play a critical role in neuronal lineage commitment. In addition, we mapped cell-type and temporally specific genetic loci implicated in neuropsychiatric traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity.

	abstract = {Background Understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of a compound is an often challenging but equally crucial aspect of drug discovery that can help improve both its efficacy and safety. Computational methods to aid MoA elucidation usually either aim to predict direct drug targets, or attempt to understand modulated downstream pathways or signalling proteins. Such methods usually require extensive coding experience and results are often optimised for further computational processing, making them difficult for wet-lab scientists to perform, interpret and draw hypotheses from.Results To address this issue, we in this work present MAVEN (Mechanism of Action Visualisation and Enrichment), an R/Shiny app which allows for GUI-based prediction of drug targets based on chemical structure, combined with causal reasoning based on causal protein-protein interactions and transcriptomic perturbation signatures. The app computes a systems-level view of the mechanism of action of the input compound. This is visualised as a sub-network linking predicted or known targets to modulated transcription factors via inferred signalling proteins. The tool includes a selection of MsigDB gene set collections to perform pathway enrichment on the resulting network, and also allows for custom gene sets to be uploaded by the researcher. MAVEN is hence a user-friendly, flexible tool for researchers without extensive bioinformatics or cheminformatics knowledge to generate interpretable hypotheses of compound Mechanism of Action.Conclusions MAVEN is available as a fully open-source tool at https://github.com/laylagerami/MAVEN with options to install in a Docker or Singularity container.

	abstract = {Motivation Constraint-based models (CBMs) are used to study the metabolic networks of organisms ranging from microbes to multicellular eukaryotes. Published CBMs are usually generic rather than context-specific, meaning that they do not capture metabolic differences between cell types, tissues, environments, or other conditions. However, only a subset of reactions in a model are likely to be active in any given context, and several methods have therefore been developed to extract context-specific models from generic CBMs through integration of omics data.Results We tested the ability of six model extraction methods (MEMs) to create functionally accurate context-specific models of Atlantic salmon using a generic CBM (SALARECON) and liver transcriptomics data from contexts differing in water salinity (life stage) and dietary lipids. Reaction contents and metabolic task feasibility predictions of context-specific CBMs were mainly determined by the MEM that was used, but life stage explained significant variance in both contents and predictions for some MEMs. Three MEMs clearly outperformed the others in terms of their ability to capture context-specific metabolic activities inferred directly from the data, and one of these (GIMME) was much faster than the others. Context-specific versions of SALARECON consistently outperformed the generic version, showing that context-specific modeling captures more realistic representations of Atlantic salmon metabolism.Contact jon.vik{at}nmbu.noCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In the real world, making sequences of decisions to achieve goals often depends upon the ability to learn aspects of the environment that are not directly perceptible. Learning these so-called latent features requires seeking information about them, a process distinct from learning about near-term reward contingencies. Prior efforts to study latent feature learning often use single decisions, use few features, and fail to distinguish between reward-seeking and informationseeking. To overcome this, we designed a task in which humans and monkeys made a series of choices to search for shapes hidden on a grid. Reward and information outcomes from uncovering parts of shapes were not perfectly correlated and their effects could be disentangled. Members of both species adeptly learned the shapes and preferred to select informative tiles earlier in trials than rewarding ones, searching a part of the grid until their outcomes dropped below the average information outcome{\textendash}a pattern consistent with foraging behavior. In addition, how quickly humans learned the shapes was predicted by how well their choice sequences matched the foraging pattern. This adaptive search for information may underlie the ability in humans and monkeys to learn latent features to support goal-directed behavior in the long run.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The Locus Coeruleus (LC) is the primary noradrenergic nucleus in the brain with widespread projections driving changes in cognitive state and animal behaviour. The LC is composed of multiple {\textquotedblleft}modules{\textquotedblright} with specific efferent target domains enabling discretional neuromodulation. LC neuronal activity releases noradrenaline within the nucleus as a local feedback mechanism, but it is not known how this influences modular output. We address this question using whole-cell recordings and calcium imaging in rat pontine slices in combination with LC neuronal ensemble modelling to assess the influence of local noradrenaline release on cross-modular interactions.Electrophysiological recordings of LC neurons from rats transduced with the optogenetic actuator ChR2 showed auto-inhibition and lateral inhibition (of surrounding non-transduced neurons). This inhibition was strongly frequency dependent and was mediated by noradrenaline acting on alpha2-adrenceptors (α2R). To allow calcium-imaging of LC neuronal ensembles a Canine-Adenoviral vector strategy was developed using the PRS promoter to drive selective expression GCaMP6s. Calcium imaging allowed resolution of both increases and decreases in LC activity (to TTX / clonidine or high potassium). Selective chemogenetic-activation of subsets of LC neurons (expressing the ionotropic actuator PSAM) revealed both a direct excitation (after application of PSEM308, 3-30{\textmu}M) and an α2R-mediated inhibition of neighbouring LC cells (non-transduced). Differential retrograde targeting of PSAM or GCaMP6s to specific LC modules showed the presence of strong, reciprocal cross-modular inhibition (shown for the LC-olfactory bulb vs LC bulbospinal modules) and a subsequent rebound activity inversion.This represents a preferential, targeted, cross-modular, lateral inhibition within the LC rather than a non-specific surround inhibition. Computational modelling showed the emergence of lateral inhibition and biphasic responses to modular activation when α2R signalling and noradrenergic reuptake saturation were included. This interaction may facilitate recruitment of neuronal ensembles by coherent inputs and represents a bottom-up differential contrast-enhancement mechanism within the LC to produce a modality specific focus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Subjective experience, however, suggests that externally available (i.e., perceived) information is more strongly represented in neural signals than memorized information. To distinguish between these possibilities, we use EEG multivariate pattern analysis to quantify the strength of representation of task-relevant features (color or spatial frequency) in anticipation of a change-detection task. Perceptual availability was manipulated between experimental blocks by either keeping the stimulus on the screen during a two second delay period (perception) or removing it shortly after its initial presentation for the same time period (memory). We find that task-relevant (i.e., attended) memorized features are more strongly represented than irrelevant features. More importantly, we find significantly weaker representations for available (perceived and attended) features than for unavailable (memorized and attended) features. Contrary to what subjective experience suggests, our findings demonstrate that vividly perceived and attended stimuli elicit weaker neural representations (in terms of detectable multivariate information) than stimuli maintained in visual working memory. We hypothesize that an efficient visual system spends little of its limited resources on the internal representation of information that is externally available anyway.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Despite long-standing philosophical and scientific interest in the relationship between the body and brain, the neural systems involved in SoA and BO and especially their interactions, are not yet understood. In this preregistered study using the Moving Rubber Hand Illusion inside an MR-scanner, we aimed to uncover the relationship between BO \&amp; SoA in the human brain. Importantly, by using both visuomotor and visuotactile stimulations and measuring online trial-by-trial fluctuations in the illusion magnitude, we were able to disentangle brain systems related to objective sensory stimulation and subjective judgments of the bodily-self. Our results indicate that at both the behavioral and neural levels, BO and SoA are strongly interrelated. Multisensory regions in the occipital and fronto-parietal regions encoded convergence of sensory stimulation conditions. However, the subjective judgments of bodily-self were also related to BOLD fluctuations in regions not activated by the sensory conditions such as the insular cortex and precuneus. Our results highlight the convergence of multisensory processing in specific neural systems for both BO and SoA with partially dissociable regions for subjective judgments in regions of the default mode network.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {When faced with navigating back somewhere we have been before we might either retrace our steps or seek a shorter path. Both choices have costs. Here, we ask whether it is possible to characterize formally the choice of navigational plans as a bounded rational process that trades off the quality of the plan (e.g., its length) and the cognitive cost required to find and implement it. We analyze the navigation strategies of two groups of people that are firstly trained to follow a {\textquotedblleft}default policy{\textquotedblright} taking a route in a virtual maze and then asked to navigate to various known goal destinations, either in the way they want ({\textquotedblleft}Go To Goal{\textquotedblright}) or by taking novel shortcuts ({\textquotedblleft}Take Shortcut{\textquotedblright}). We address these wayfinding problems using InfoRL: an information-theoretic approach that formalizes the cognitive cost of devising a navigational plan, as the informational cost to deviate from a well-learned route (the {\textquotedblleft}default policy{\textquotedblright}). In InfoRL, optimality refers to finding the best trade-off between route length and the amount of control information required to find it. We report five main findings. First, the navigational strategies automatically identified by InfoRL correspond closely to different routes (optimal or suboptimal) in the virtual reality map, which were annotated by hand in previous research. Second, people deliberate more in places where the value of investing cognitive resources (i.e., relevant goal information) is greater. Third, compared to the group of people who receive the {\textquotedblleft}Go To Goal{\textquotedblright} instruction, those who receive the {\textquotedblleft}Take Shortcut{\textquotedblright} instruction find shorter but less optimal solutions, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of finding optimal shortcuts. Fourth, those who receive the {\textquotedblleft}Go To Goal{\textquotedblright} instruction modulate flexibly their cognitive resources, depending on the benefits of finding the shortcut. Finally, we found a surprising amount of variability in the choice of navigational strategies and resource investment across participants. Taken together, these results illustrate the benefits of using InfoRL to address navigational planning problems from a bounded rational perspective.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), allowing for the examination of associations between two sets of variables, we related the functional connectome of brain regions implicated in interoception to a selection of non-imaging health and lifestyle related phenotypes, exploring their relationship within modes of population co-variation.In one integrated and data driven analysis, we obtained four statistically significant modes. Modes could be categorised into domains of affect and cardiovascular health, breathing, obesity, and subjective health (all p \&lt; 0.0001) and were meaningfully associated with distinct neural circuits.Circuits represent specific neural {\textquotedblleft}fingerprints{\textquotedblright} of functional domains and set the scope for future studies on the neurobiology of interoceptive involvement in different lifestyle and health related phenotypes. Therefore, our research contributes to the conceptualisation of interoception and may lead to a better understanding of co-morbid conditions in the light of shared interoceptive structures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The fact that we cannot tickle ourselves is traditionally explained by the attenuation of somatosensation by predictions from a forward model of self-generated movements. Alternatively, it has been suggested within the framework of active inference that Bayes-optimal reduction of sensory precision can explain this phenomenon. Combining a pain paradigm with stimulus-related expectations allows to compare both models through predictions from the Bayesian account of expectation-based hypoalgesia, where pain is influenced by the precisions of somatosensation and expectation. In two experiments, heat pain was sham-treated either externally or by the subject, while a cue created higher or lower treatment expectations. Both experiments revealed greater pain relief under self-treatment and high treatment expectations. Electroencephalography revealed a modulation of theta-to-beta frequencies linked to agency and top-down modulations of pain perception. Computational modeling showed that this is better explained by an attenuation of somatosensation than a downregulation of somatosensation precision, favoring the forward model.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Humans modulate the behavior flexibly after timely receiving and processing information from the environment. To better understand and measure human behavior in the driving process, we integrate humans and the environment as a system. The eye-movement methodologies are used to provide a bridge between humans and environment. Thus, we conduct a goal-directed task in virtual driving to investigate the law of eye-movement that could characterize the humans (internal) and environmental (external) state measured by fixation distribution and optical flows distribution. The analysis of eye-movement data combined with the information-theoretic tool, transfer entropy, active information storage, quantify the humans{\textquoteright} cognitive effort and receiving information, and in fact, there is a balance (optimal) range between two, because of the mutual synergy and inhibition, whose quantified value is named balance of information processing. Subsequently, we update a system-level model, finding that those information measurements, transfer entropy, active information storage, and balance of information processing, all are included. This information set is information flow, which is quantified by the square root of Jensen-Shannon divergence (SRJSD), named information flow gain. What{\textquoteright}s more, results also demonstrate that the influence of system-level information flow correlated with behavioral performance stronger than the separate measurements. In conclusion, we research humans{\textquoteright} eye-movement based on information theory to analyze behavioral performance. Besides driving, these measurements may be a predictor for other behaviors such as walking, running, etc. Still, the limitation is that the information flow may be a proxy of determinants of behavior.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Sequential sampling models of choice, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM), are frequently fit to empirical data to account for a variety of effects related to choice accuracy/consistency and response time (RT). Sometimes, these models include extensions that can also account for choice confidence. However, no model in this class is able to account for the phenomenon of choice-induced preference change. Studies have reported choice-induced preference change for many decades, and the principle findings are robust: decision-makers tend to rate options higher after they choose them and lower after they reject them. This spreading of alternatives (SoA) in terms of their rated values is fundamentally incompatible with traditional sequential sampling models, which consider the rated values of the options to be stationary throughout choice deliberation. Here, we propose a simple modification of the basic DDM that allows the drift rate to vary across deliberation time depending on which attributes are attended to at which points in time. Critically, the model assumes that initial ratings are based only on the more salient attributes of the individual options, and that more attributes will be considered when decision-makers must choose between options with different salient attributes. We show that this model can account for SoA (in addition to choice consistency and RT), as well as all previously reported relationships between SoA and choice difficulty, attribute disparity, and RT.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The brain{\textquoteright}s structural connectome supports signal propagation between neuronal elements, shaping diverse coactivation patterns that can be captured as functional connectivity. While the link between structure and function remains an ongoing challenge, the prevailing hypothesis is that the structure-function relationship may itself be gradually decoupled along a macroscale functional gradient spanning unimodal to transmodal regions. However, this hypothesis is strongly constrained by the underlying models which may neglect requisite signaling mechanisms. Here, we transform the structural connectome into a set of orthogonal eigenmodes governing frequency-specific diffusion patterns and show that regional structure-function relationships vary markedly under different signaling mechanisms. Specifically, low-frequency eigenmodes, which are considered sufficient to capture the essence of the functional network, contribute little to functional connectivity reconstruction in transmodal regions, resulting in structurefunction decoupling along the unimodal-transmodal gradient. In contrast, high-frequency eigenmodes, which are usually on the periphery of attention due to their association with noisy and random dynamical patterns, contribute significantly to functional connectivity prediction in transmodal regions, inducing gradually convergent structure-function relationships from unimodal to transmodal regions. Although the information in high-frequency eigenmodes is weak and scattered, it effectively enhances the structure-function correspondence by 35\% in unimodal regions and 56\% in transmodal regions. Altogether, our findings suggest that the structure-function divergence in transmodal areas may not be an intrinsic property of brain organization, but can be narrowed through multiplexed and regionally specialized signaling mechanisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We investigated whether experienced meditators showed different neural activity related to performance monitoring and error-processing. Previous research has produced inconsistent results. This study used more rigorous analyses and a larger sample to resolve the inconsistencies.Methods We used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) following correct and incorrect responses to a Go/Nogo task from 27 experienced meditators and 27 non-meditators.Results No differences were found in the ERN (all p \&gt; 0.05). Meditators showed larger global field potentials (GFP) in the Pe after both correct responses and errors, indicating stronger neural responses (p = 0.0190, FDR-p = 0.152, np2 = 0.0951, BFincl = 2.691). This effect did not pass multiple comparison controls. However, single electrode analysis of the Pe did pass multiple comparison controls (p = 0.002, FDR-p = 0.016, np2 = 0.133, BFincl = 220.659). Meditators also showed a significantly larger Pe GFP for errors only, which would have passed multiple comparison controls, but was not a primary analysis (p = 0.0028, np2 = 0.1493, BF10 = 9.999).Conclusions Meditation may strengthen neural responses related to performance monitoring (measured by the Pe), but not specifically to error monitoring (although measurements of the Pe after errors may be more sensitive to group differences). However, only the single electrode analysis passed multiple comparison controls, while analysis including all electrodes did not, so this conclusion remains tentative.Competing Interest StatementIn the last 3 years PBF has received equipment for research from Neurosoft, Medtronic Ltd. and Brainsway Ltd.

	abstract = {Fast-adapting type 1 (FA-1) and slow-adapting type 1 (SA-1) first-order neurons in the human tactile system have distal axons that branch in the skin and form many transduction sites, yielding receptive fields with many highly sensitive zones or {\textquoteleft}subfields{\textquoteright}. We previously demonstrated that this arrangement allows FA-1 and SA-1 neurons to signal the geometric features of touched objects, specifically the orientation of raised edges scanned with the fingertips. Here we show that such signaling operates for fine edge orientation differences (5-20{\textdegree}) and is stable across a broad range of scanning speeds (15-180 mm/s); that is, under conditions relevant for real-world hand use. We found that both FA-1 and SA-1 neurons weakly signal fine edge orientation differences via the intensity of their spiking responses and only when considering a single scanning speed. Both neuron types showed much stronger edge orientation signaling in the sequential structure of the evoked spike trains and FA-1 neurons performed better than SA-1 neurons. Represented in the spatial domain, the sequential structure was strikingly invariant across scanning speeds, especially those naturally used in tactile spatial discrimination tasks. This speed invariance suggests that neurons{\textquoteright} responses are structured via sequential stimulation of their subfields and thus links this capacity to their terminal organization in the skin. Indeed, the spatial precision of elicited action potentials rationally matched spatial acuity of subfield arrangements, which typically corresponds to the dimension of individual fingertip ridges.Significance Statement The distal axons of human first-order tactile neurons branch and innervate many mechanosensitive end organs in the skin. For those neurons terminating in end organs associated with fingerprint ridges (Meissner and Merkel), this branching results in cutaneous receptive fields with multiple subfields spread across several ridges. Consequently, when a fingertip scans the surface of an object, the spatial coincidence between a neuron{\textquoteright}s subfields and the tactile stimulus defines the sequential structure of the evoked spike train (i.e., the presence of action potential bursts and the gaps between them). Here we show that, for surfaces composed of oriented edges, this sequential structure signals information about edge orientation differences at the limit of what people can feel and that the spatial precision of the structuring is maintained across a broad range of speeds relevant for real-world hand use. We submit that, to be of human relevance, models of higher order tactile processing must consider the impact of multifocal receptive fields in the periphery. For example, the speed invariance of tactile fine-form/texture perception may arise simply because the same subsets of peripheral subfields in the population of first-order tactile neurons are stimulated together regardless of speed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Background Synapses and spines are central in major depressive disorder (MDD) pathophysiology, recently highlighted by ketamine{\textquoteright}s and psilocybin{\textquoteright}s rapid antidepressant effects. The Bayesian brain and interoception perspectives formalize MDD as being {\textquotedblleft}stuck{\textquotedblright} in affective states constantly predicting negative energy balance. We examined how synaptic atrophy relates to the predictive function of the neocortex and thus to symptoms, using temporal memory (TM), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm. TM represents a single neocortical layer, learns in real-time using local Hebbian-learning rules, and extracts and predicts temporal sequences.Methods We trained a TM model on random sequences of upper-case alphabetical letters, representing sequences of affective states. To model depression, we progressively destroyed synapses in the TM model and examined how that affected the predictive capacity of the network.Results Destroying 50\% of the synapses slightly reduced the number of predictions, followed by a marked drop with further destruction. However, reducing the synapses by 25\% dropped the confidence in the predictions distinctly. So even though the network was making accurate predictions, the network was no longer confident about these predictions.Conclusions These findings explain how interoceptive cortices could be stuck in limited affective states with high prediction error. Growth of new synapses, e.g., with ketamine and psilocybin, would allow representing more futuristic predictions with higher confidence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the TM model to connect changes happening at synaptic levels to the Bayesian formulation of psychiatric symptomatology, making it possible to understand treatment mechanisms and possibly, develop new treatments.Competing Interest StatementMAS is a consultant for In Silico Biosciences, Inc.

Using a Bayesian model of belief updating, we show that sulpiride increased the volatility of beliefs, which led to higher precision-weights on prediction errors.

	abstract = {The brain systems of episodic memory and oculomotor control are tightly linked, suggesting a crucial role of eye movements in memory. But little is known about the neural mechanisms of memory formation across eye movements in unrestricted viewing behavior. Here, we leverage simultaneous eye tracking and EEG recording to examine episodic memory formation in free viewing. Participants memorized multi-element events while their EEG and eye movements were concurrently recorded. Each event comprised elements from three categories (face, object, place), with two exemplars from each category, in different locations on the screen. A subsequent associative memory test assessed participants{\textquoteright} memory for the between-category associations that specified each event. We used a deconvolution approach to overcome the problem of overlapping EEG responses to sequential saccades in free viewing. Brain activity was time-locked to the fixation onsets, and we examined EEG power in the theta and alpha frequency bands, the putative oscillatory correlates of episodic encoding mechanisms. Three modulations of fixation-related EEG predicted high subsequent memory performance: 1) theta increase at fixations after between-category gaze transitions, 2) theta and alpha increase at fixations after within-element gaze transitions, 3) alpha decrease at fixations after between-exemplar gaze transitions. Thus, event encoding with unrestricted viewing behavior was characterized by three neural mechanisms, manifested in fixation-locked theta and alpha EEG activity that rapidly turned on and off during the unfolding eye movement sequences. These three distinct neural mechanisms may be the essential building blocks that subserve the buildup of coherent episodic memories during unrestricted viewing behavior.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Within predictive processing learning is construed as Bayesian model updating with the degree of certainty for different existing hypotheses changing in light of new evidence. Bayesian model updating, however, cannot explain how new hypotheses are added to a model. Model revision, unlike model updating, makes structural changes to a generative model by altering its causal connections or adding or removing hypotheses. Whilst model updating and model revision have recently been formally differentiated, they have not been empirically distinguished. The aim of this research was to empirically differentiate between model updating and revision on the basis of how they affect prediction errors and predictions over time. To study this, participants took part in a within-subject computer-based learning experiment with two phases: updating and revision. In the updating phase, participants had to predict the relationship between cues and target stimuli and in the revision phase, they had to correctly predict a change in the said relationship. Based on previous research, phasic pupil dilation was taken as a proxy for prediction error. During model updating, we expected that the prediction errors over trials would be gradually decreasing as a reflection of the continuous integration of new evidence. During model revision, in contrast, prediction errors over trials were expected to show an abrupt decrease following the successful integration of a new hypothesis within the existing model. The opposite results were expected for predictions. Our results show that the learning dynamics as reflected in pupil and accuracy data are indeed qualitatively different between the revision and the updating phase, however in the opposite direction as expected. Participants were learning more gradually in the revision phase compared to the updating phase. This could imply that participants first built multiple models from scratch in the updating phase and updated them in the revision phase.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In performing source space analyses, localization accuracy poses a bottleneck, which precise forward models based on individualized attributes such as subject anatomy or electrode locations aim to overcome. Yet acquiring anatomical images or localizing EEG electrodes requires significant additional funds and processing time, making it an oftentimes inaccessible asset. Neuroscientific software offers template solutions, on which analyses can be based. For localizing the source of auditory evoked responses, we here compared the results of employing such template anatomies and electrode positions versus the subject-specific ones, as well as combinations of the two. All considered cases represented approaches commonly used in electrophysiological studies. We considered differences between two commonly used inverse solutions (dSPM, sLORETA) and targeted the primary auditory cortex; a notoriously small cortical region that is located within the lateral sulcus, thus more prone to errors in localization. Through systematical comparison of the outcomes in terms of auditory activity attributes and leakage quantification, we assessed how the individualization steps impacted the analyses outcomes. Both electrode locations as well as subject anatomies were found to have an effect, which though varied based on the configuration considered. When comparing the inverse solutions, we moreover found that dSPM more consistently benefited from individualization of subject characteristics. Based on the scientific question considered, our results may be used to facilitate the planning of auditory neuroscientific experiments in terms of expected infrastructure, personnel and funds.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Humans learn internal models of the environment that support efficient planning and flexible generalization in complex, real-world domains. Yet it remains unclear how such internal models are represented and learned in the brain. We approach this question within the framework of theory-based reinforcement learning, a strong form of model-based reinforcement learning in which the model is an intuitive theory {\textendash} a rich, abstract, causal model of the environment built on a natural ontology of physical objects, intentional agents, relations, and goals. We used a theory-based reinforcement learning model to analyze brain data from human participants learning to play different Atari-style video games while undergoing functional MRI. Theories inferred by the theory-based model explained the signal in inferior frontal gyrus and other prefrontal areas better than several alternative models. Brain activity increased in response to theory update events in inferior frontal gyrus, occipital cortex, and fusiform gyrus, with separate learning signals for different theory components. This corresponded with a transient strengthening of theory representations in those regions. Finally, the effective connectivity pattern during theory updating suggests that information flows top-down from theory-coding regions in the prefrontal cortex to theory updating regions in occipital and temporal cortex. These results are consistent with a neural architecture in which top-down theory representations originating in prefrontal regions shape sensory predictions in visual areas, where factorized theory prediction errors are computed and in turn trigger bottom-up updates of the theory. This initial sketch provides a foundation for understanding of the neural representations and computations that support efficient theory-based reinforcement learning in complex, naturalistic environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {We present a normative computational theory of how neural circuitry may support visually-guided goal-directed actions in a dynamic environment. The model builds on Active Inference, in which perception and motor control signals are inferred through dynamic minimization of generalized prediction errors. The Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) is proposed to maintain constantly updated expectations, or beliefs over the environmental state, and by manipulating them through flexible intentions it is involved in dynamically generating goal-directed actions. In turn, the Dorsal Visual Stream (DVS) and the proprioceptive pathway implement generative models that translate the high-level belief into sensory-level predictions to infer targets, posture, and motor commands. A proof-of-concept agent embodying visual and proprioceptive sensors and an actuated upper limb was tested on target-reaching tasks. The agent behaved correctly under various conditions, including static and dynamic targets, different sensory feedbacks, sensory precisions, intention gains, and movement policies; limit conditions were individuated, too. Active Inference driven by dynamic and flexible intentions can thus support goal-directed behavior in constantly changing environments, and the PPC putatively hosts its core intention mechanism. More broadly, the study provides a normative basis for research on goal-directed behavior in end-to-end settings and further advances mechanistic theories of active biological systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Despite being aware of negative consequences and wanting to quit, long-term addicts find it difficult to quit seeking and consuming drugs. This inconsistency between the (often compulsive) behavioural patterns and the explicit knowledge of negative consequences represents a cognitive conflict which is a central characteristic of addiction. Neurobiologically, differential cue-induced activity in distinct striatal subregions, as well as the dopamine connectivity spiraling from ventral striatal regions to the dorsal regions, play critical roles in compulsive drug seeking. The focus of this work is to illustrate the mechanisms that lead to a cognitive conflict and it{\textquoteright}s impact on actions taken i.e. addictive choices. We propose an algorithmic model that captures how the action choices that the agent makes when reinforced with drug-rewards become incongruent with the presence of negative consequences that often follow those choices. We advance the understanding of having a decision hierarchy in representing {\textquotedblleft}cognitive control{\textquotedblright} and how lack of such control at higher-level in the hierarchy could potentially lead to consolidated drug-seeking habits. We further propose a cost-benefit based arbitration scheme, which mediates the allocation of control across different levels of the decision-making hierarchy. Lastly, we discuss how our work on extending a computational model to an algorithmic one, could in turn also helps us improve the understanding of how drugs hijack the dopamine-spiralling circuit at an implementation level.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Although the temporal structure of the world around us is essential for human decision making, we know surprisingly little about how representation of temporal structure of our everyday environment impacts decision making. How does the representation of temporal structure affect our ability to generate well-timed decisions? Here we address this question by using a well-established dynamic probabilistic learning task. Using computational modelling, we found that human subjects{\textquoteright} beliefs about temporal structure are reflected in their choices to either exploit their current knowledge or to explore novel options. The model-based analysis illustrates a large within-group and within-subject heterogeneity. To explain these results, we propose a normative model for how temporal structure is used in decision making, based on the semi-Markov formalism in an active inference framework.

In contrast, the neonatal CA1 is tightly linked to externally-generated sensorimotor activity but the circuit mechanisms underlying early synchronous activity in CA1 remain unclear. Here, using a combination of in vivo and ex vivo circuit mapping, calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings in mouse pups, we show that early dynamics in the ventro-intermediate CA1 are under the mixed influence of entorhinal (EC) and thalamic (VMT) inputs. Both VMT and EC can drive internally-generated synchronous events ex vivo. However, movement-related population bursts detected in vivo are exclusively driven by the EC. These differential effects on synchrony reflect the different intrahippocampal targets of these inputs. Hence, cortical and subcortical pathways act differently on the neonatal CA1, implying distinct contributions to the development of the hippocampal microcircuit and related cognitive maps.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The neural circuit of the brain is organized as a hierarchy of functional units with wide-ranging connections that support information flow and functional connectivity. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicate a moderate coupling between structural and functional connectivity at the system level. However, how do connections of different directions (feedforward and feedback) and regions with different excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neurons shape the hemodynamic activity and functional connectivity over the hierarchy are unknown. Here, we used functional MRI to detect optogenetic-evoked and resting-state activities over a somatosensory pathway in the mouse brain in relation to axonal projection and E/I distribution. Using a highly sensitive ultrafast imaging, we identified extensive activation in regions up to the third order of axonal projections following optogenetic excitation of the ventral posteriomedial nucleus of the thalamus. The evoked response and functional connectivity correlated with feedforward projections more than feedback projections and weakened with the hierarchy. The hemodynamic response exhibited regional and hierarchical differences, with slower and more variable responses in high-order areas and bipolar response predominantly in the contralateral cortex. Importantly, the positive and negative parts of the hemodynamic response correlated with E/I neuronal densities, respectively. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity was more associated with E/I distribution whereas stimulus-evoked effective connectivity followed structural wiring. These findings indicate that the structure-function relationship is projection-, cell-type- and hierarchy-dependent. Hemodynamic transients could reflect E/I activity and the increased complexity of hierarchical processing.Significance Statement The neural circuit of the brain is organized as a hierarchy of functional units with complicated feedforward and feedback connections to selectively enhance (excitation) or suppress (inhibit) information from massive sensory inputs. How brain activity is shaped by the structural wiring and excitatory and inhibitory neurons is still unclear. We characterize how brain-wide hemodynamic responses reflect these structural constituents over the hierarchy of a somatosensory pathway. We find that functional activation and connectivity correlate with feedforward connection strengths and neuronal distributions. This association subsides with hierarchy due to slower and more variable hemodynamic responses, reflecting increased complexity of processing and neuronal compositions in high-order areas. Our findings indicate that hemodynamics follow the hierarchy of structural wiring and neuronal distribution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The model successfully described irrational behaviors depending on the curiosity level. We then proposed a machine learning method to decode temporal curiosity from behavioral data, which enables us to quantitatively compare estimated curiosity and neural activities. By applying it to rat behavioral data, we found that the irrational choices sticking to one option was reflected to the negative curiosity level. Our decoding approach can be a fundamental tool for identifying the neural basis for reward-curiosity conflicts.

Whether inter-individual {\textquotedblleft}prediction tendencies{\textquotedblright} shape listening experiences of real-world stimuli such as speech is, however, unknown. In the current study, we used a passive paradigm presenting tone sequences of varying entropy level, to independently quantify auditory prediction tendency (as the tendency to anticipate low-level acoustic features according to their contextual probability) for each individual. This measure was then used to predict the magnitude of cortical speech (envelope) tracking in a multi speaker listening task, where participants listened to audiobooks narrated by a target speaker in isolation or interfered by 1 or 2 distractors. Furthermore, rare semantic violations were introduced into the story, enabling us to also examine effects of word surprisal during continuous speech processing. Our results show that individual prediction tendency facilitates cortical speech tracking. Furthermore, we find interactions between individual prediction tendency and background noise as well as word surprisal in disparate brain regions. In sum, our findings suggest that individual prediction tendencies are generalizable across different listening situations and may serve as a valuable element to explain interindividual differences in natural listening experience.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a model of hippocampal-based category learning using a cluster-based inference framework which produces two systems (i) an extendable cluster-based memory module (CMM) that provides representations of learning episodes with strong pattern separation, and supports online decision making during that learning, (ii) cluster-based task modules (CTMs) which consolidate clusters learnt by CMM to support higher-accuracy decision making in the mid-term. Learning in CMMs optimises the joint probability of stimuli and category labels, whereas learning in CTMs optimises the probability of categories given stimuli. The latter system learns from the former via a process of {\textquotedblleft}cluster consolidation{\textquotedblright}. We apply the model to data from a behavioral learning task and find that, as well as improving categorisation performance, cluster consolidation decreases recognition scores for old cues but increases them for novel cues. This model-based perspective explains forgetting and false memory effects as serving future categorisation performance. The paper also expresses a view that models of memorybased cognition should provide human-level performance on complex categorisation tasks, and do so with minimal labelled data. In working toward this goal we therefore compared the accuracy of CMM- and CTM-based decision making to standard Softmax Regression approaches on benchmark machine learning datasets. This produced mixed results. We found some significant improvements of CMM over Softmax Regression and of CTM over CMM. Overall, our framework reconciles complementary learning systems theory with more recent findings from cognitive neuroscience of generative replay and hippocampal-based generalisation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Detecting errors in one{\textquoteright}s own and other{\textquoteright}s actions is likely linked to the discrepancy between intended or expected and produced or observed output. To detect and process the occurrence of salient events seems associated to the release of dopamine, the balance of which is profoundly altered in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD). EEG studies in healthy participants indicate that the occurrence of errors in observed actions triggers a variety of electrocortical indices (like mid-frontal theta activity, error-related delta and the Error Positivity, oPe), that seem to map different aspects of error detection and performance monitoring. Whether these indices are differently modulated by dopamine in the same individual has never been investigated. To explore this issue, we recorded EEG markers of error detection by asking healthy controls (HCs) and PD patients to observe ecological reach-to-grasp a glass actions performed by a virtual arm seen in first person perspective. PD patients were tested under their dopaminergic medication ({\textquoteleft}on-condition{\textquoteright}), and after dopaminergic withdrawal ({\textquoteleft}off-condition{\textquoteright}). HCs showed a clear oPe and an increase of delta and theta power during the observation of erroneous vs. correct actions. In PD patients, oPe and delta responses were always preserved. Crucially, however, an error-related increase of theta power was found in {\textquoteleft}on{\textquoteright} but not in {\textquoteleft}off{\textquoteright} state PD patients. Thus, different EEG error signatures may index the activity of independent systems and error related theta power is selectively modulated by dopamine depletion. Our findings may pave the way to the discovery of dopamine-related biomarkers of higher-order motor cognition dysfunctions that may have crucial theoretical and clinical implications.Significance Statement Dopaminergic neurons respond to salient events during performance monitoring. Yet, the impact of dopamine depletion on the human reactivity to observed errors is still unclear. We recorded EEG in patients with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s Disease (PD) under dopaminergic treatment ({\textquoteleft}on-condition{\textquoteright}) and medication withdrawal ({\textquoteleft}off-condition{\textquoteright}) while they observed correct and erroneous goal-related actions performed by a virtual limb. Analysis of Error Positivity (oPe) and theta and delta power increase, markers of physiological error-monitoring, indicates that while the formers were intact, the latter was preserved in the {\textquoteleft}on{\textquoteright} and altered in the {\textquoteleft}off{\textquoteright} condition. Thus, different EEG markers of error monitoring likely rely on independent circuits. Moreover, mid-frontal theta activity alterations may represent a marker of dopamine-related neurophysiological impairments of higher-order cognition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

While humans are known to exploit their capacity to contextualize to facilitate this process, how internal knowledge is deployed on-line remains an open question. Here, we present a model that extracts multiple levels of information from continuous speech online. The model applies linguistic and nonlinguistic knowledge to speech processing, by periodically generating top-down predictions and incorporating bottom-up incoming evidence in a nested temporal hierarchy. We show that a nonlinguistic context level provides semantic predictions informed by sensory inputs, which are crucial for disambiguating among multiple meanings of the same word. The explicit knowledge hierarchy of the model enables a more holistic account of the neurophysiological responses to speech compared to using lexical predictions generated by a neural-network language model (GPT-2). We also show that hierarchical predictions reduce peripheral processing via minimizing uncertainty and prediction error. With this proof-of-concept model we demonstrate that the deployment of hierarchical predictions is a possible strategy for the brain to dynamically utilize structured knowledge and make sense of the speech input.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Also, we learned transcription factor activities using a linear model of gene regulation. Considering dynamic changes and correlations, we identified lineage-specific regulators. We applied FateCompass to an islet cell formation dataset from the mouse embryo, and we found known and novel potential cell-type drivers. Also, when applied to a differentiation protocol dataset towards beta-like cells, we pinpointed undescribed regulators of an off-target population, which were experimentally validated. Thus, as a framework for identifying lineage-specific transcription factors, FateCompass could have implications on hypothesis generation to increase the understanding of the gene regulatory networks driving cell fate choices.HighlightsWe developed FateCompass, a flexible pipeline to estimate transcription factor activities during cell-fate decision using single-cell RNA seq data.FateCompass outlines gene expression stochastic trajectories by infusing the direction of differentiation using RNA velocity or a differentiation potential when RNA velocity fails.Transcription factor dynamics allow the identification of time-specific regulatory interactions.FateCompass predictions revealed known and novel cell-subtype-specific regulators of mouse pancreatic islet cell development.Differential motif analysis predicts lineage-specific regulators of stem cell-derived human β- cells and sheds light on the cellular heterogeneity of β-cell differentiation protocols.Experimental validation supports the proposed GRN controlling SC-EC differentiation predicted by FateCompass.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Language processing is a highly integrative function, intertwining linguistic operations (processing the language code intentionally used for communication) and extra-linguistic processes (e.g., attention monitoring, predictive inference, long-term memory). This synergetic cognitive architecture requires a distributed and specialized neural substrate. Brain systems have mostly been examined at rest. However, task-related functional connectivity provides additional and valuable information about how information is processed when various cognitive states are involved. We gathered thirteen language fMRI tasks in a unique database of one hundred and fifty neurotypical adults (InLang database). The tasks were designed to assess a wide range of linguistic processes and subprocesses. From this database, we applied network theory as a computational tool to model the task-related functional connectome of language (LANG). The organization of this data-driven neurocognitive atlas of language is examined at multiple levels, uncovering its major components (or crucial subnetworks) and its anatomical and functional correlates. Furthermore, we estimate its reconfiguration as a function of linguistic demand (flexibility), or several factors such as age or gender (variability). By accounting for the multifaceted nature of language and modulating factors, this study can contribute to enrich and refine existing neurocognitive models of language. The LANG atlas can also be considered as a reference for comparative or clinical studies, involving a variety of patients and conditions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Respiration and emotional stimuli modulate cognitive ability and the reaction time to generate bodily movement. To understand mechanisms for emotion-respiration-cognition coupling, first, we considered a schematic feed-forward neural network, in which neurons was biased by respiratory-relevant sensory input and the activation function of a neuron was modulated by a neuromodulator, such as norepinephrine (NE). Furthermore, we assumed that the neural model received a stimulus input and generated a response action upon the activity of the output neuron exceeding a certain threshold. Time-to-respond (TTR) was equivalently modulated by the intensity of the input bias and the neuromodulator strength for small action execution threshold; however, it was dominantly modulated by only the neuromodulator for high threshold. Second, we implemented a comprehensive model comprising a cardio-respiration relevant neuromechanical-gas system, a respiratory central pattern generator (CPG), NE dynamics to modulate neurocognitive dynamics, and a locus coeruleus (LC) circuit, which was the primary nucleus for controlling NE. The LC neurons received pCO2 or synaptic current from an inspiratory neurons, which resulted in shortened TTR by a stimulus input during inhalation. By contrast, upon receiving pulmonary stretch information, the TTR was shortened by a stimulus input during exhalation. In humans, TTR is shortened when a fear-related stimulus is presented during inhalation, and likewise, TTR is weakly-shortened when surprise-related stimulus is presented during exhalation. Hence, we conclude that emotional stimuli in humans may switch the gating strategies of information and the inflow to LC to change the attention or behavior strategy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The ongoing activity of neuronal populations represents an internal brain state that influences how sensory information is processed to control behaviour. Conversely, external sensory inputs perturb network dynamics, resulting in lasting effects that persist beyond the duration of the stimulus. However, the relationship between these dynamics and circuit architecture and their impact on sensory processing, cognition and behaviour are poorly understood. By combining cellular-resolution calcium imaging with mechanistic network modelling, we aimed to infer the spatial and temporal network interactions in the zebrafish optic tectum that shape its ongoing activity and state-dependent responses to visual input. We showed that a simple recurrent network architecture, wherein tectal dynamics are dominated by fast, short range, excitation countered by long-lasting, activity-dependent suppression, was sufficient to explain multiple facets of population activity including intermittent bursting, trial-to-trial sensory response variability and spatially-selective response adaptation. Moreover, these dynamics also predicted behavioural trends such as selective habituation of visually evoked prey-catching responses. Overall, we demonstrate that a mechanistic circuit model, built upon a uniform recurrent connectivity motif, can estimate the incidental state of a dynamic neural network and account for experience-dependent effects on sensory encoding and visually guided behaviour.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we establish microglia as a new cellular component of the sleep homeostat circuit. By using quantitative phosphoproteomics we demonstrate that microglia-derived TNFα controls thousands of phosphorylation sites during the sleep period. Substrates of microglial TNFα comprise sleep-promoting kinases and numerous synaptic proteins, including a subset whose phosphorylation status codes sleep need and determines sleep duration. As a result, lack of microglial TNFα attenuates the build-up of sleep need, as measured by slow wave activity, and prevents immediate compensation for loss of sleep. Together, we propose that microglia control sleep homeostasis by releasing TNFα that acts at the neuronal circuitry through dynamic control of phosphorylation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Previous functional-MRI (fMRI) studies confirm that auditory repetition activates these regions. Here, we used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to test how the four regions interact with each other during single word and pseudoword auditory repetition. Contrary to expectation, we found that, for both word and pseudoword repetition, the effective connectivity between Wernicke{\textquoteright}s and Broca{\textquoteright}s areas was predominantly bidirectional and inhibitory; activity in the motor cortex could be driven by either Wernicke{\textquoteright}s area or Broca{\textquoteright}s area; and the latter effect varied both within and between individuals. Such variability speaks to degenerate functional architectures that support auditory repetition and may explain resilience to functional loss after brain damage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) contribute to reward-driven behavior, but it is unclear why such behavior should rely on notoriously complex circuitry involving opponent striatal pathways. Dopamine (DA) nonlinearly modulates activity and plasticity in the BG and is itself dynamically modulated across tasks. We develop the OpAL* model to assess the normative advantages of such circuitry. In OpAL*, dynamic DA modulation differentially amplifies the striatal pathway most tuned to the accumulated history of positive or negative outcomes. This efficient coding mechanism avoids a vexing explore-exploit tradeoff that plagues traditional RL models in sparse reward environments. OpAL* exhibits robust advantages over alternative models across a range of environments, particularly with sparse reward. These advantages depend on opponent and nonlinear Hebbian plasticity mechanisms previously thought to be pathological. Finally, OpAL* captures risky choice patterns arising from DA and environmental manipulations across species, suggesting that they result from a normative biological mechanism.Everybody wants the most they can possibly getFor the least they can possibly do{\textendash} Todd Snider, {\textquotedblleft}Easy Money{\textquotedblright}Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Interoception, or an awareness of the internal body state, guides agents in adaptive behavior by informing them of ongoing bodily signals, such as heart rate or energy status. However, it is still unclear whether the human brain represents the differences in the subjective experience of interoception differently. Hence, we directly compared the neural activation for cardiac (awareness related to heartbeats) and gastric (awareness related to the stomach) interoception in the same population (healthy human, N = 31). Participants were asked to focus on their heart and stomach sensations to be aware of interoception in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The results indicated that neural activation underlying gastric interoception encompassed larger brain regions, including the occipitotemporal visual cortices, bilateral primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral hippocampal regions. Cardiac interoception, however, selectively activated the right anterior insula extending to the frontal operculum more compared to gastric interoception. Moreover, our detailed analyses focusing on the insula, the most relevant region for interoception, revealed that the left dorsal middle insula encoded cardiac and gastric interoception in different activation patterns but not the posterior insula. Our results demonstrate that cardiac and gastric interoception have distinct neural substrates; in particular, the selective brain activation may reflect differences in the functional roles of cardiac and gastric interoception.Significance statement Interoception, subjective senses that arise from within the body, plays a critical role in maintaining adaptive behavior by informing of the ongoing bodily states, such as heart rate and energy status. Although interoception has various characteristics depending on its source signals, previous neuroimaging studies have extensively used cardiac interoception (senses related to heartbeats), making it unclear whether the brain differently encodes diverse experiences of interoception. Here, we demonstrate that cardiac interoception and gastric interoception (senses related to the stomach) have distinct neural substrates by combining mass-univariate analysis with multivoxel pattern analysis for fMRI data. Our findings suggest that the selective brain activation may reflect differences in the functional roles of cardiac and gastric interoception.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Intermeshing regulatory networks controlled by these miRs revealed their high cooperativity in contributing to chronic wound pathology characterized by persistent inflammation and proliferative phase initiation failure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-34a, miR-424, and miR-516, upregulated in VU, cooperatively suppressed keratinocyte growth while promoting inflammatory response.

This has been shown by locking the presentation of stimuli to distinct cardiac phases. However, in everyday life sensory information is not presented in this phase-locked and passive manner, instead we actively sample the world. Whether active sensing is coupled and modulated with the cardiac cycle remains largely unknown. Here we recorded the ECGs of human participants while they actively performed a tactile grating orientation task. Here we show that the duration of subjects{\textquoteright} touch varied as a function of the cardiac phase in which they initiated it. Touches initiated in the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle were held for longer periods of time than touches initiated in the diastolic phase. This effect was driven by the elongation of their holds to sample the most difficult gratings. Conversely, while touches in the control condition were coupled to the cardiac cycle, their length was not modulated as a function of when in the cycle these were initiated. In line with interoceptive inference accounts, these results are consistent with the hypotheses that we actively adjust our sensory sampling so that we spend more time in the diastole period of the cardiac cycle in which perceptual sensory sensitivity is greatest.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In many brain areas, neural populations act as a coordinated network whose state is tied to behavior on a moment-by-moment basis and millisecond timescale. Two-photon (2p) calcium imaging is a powerful tool to probe network-scale computation, as it can measure the activity of many individual neurons, monitor multiple cortical layers simultaneously, and sample from identified cell types. However, estimating network state and dynamics from 2p measurements has proven challenging because of noise, inherent nonlinearities, and limitations on temporal resolution. Here we describe RADICaL, a deep learning method to overcome these limitations at the population level. RADICaL extends methods that exploit dynamics in spiking activity for application to deconvolved calcium signals, whose statistics and temporal dynamics are quite distinct from electrophysiologically-recorded spikes. It incorporates a novel network training strategy that capitalizes on the timing of 2p sampling to recover network dynamics with high temporal precision. In synthetic tests, RADICaL infers network state more accurately than previous methods, particularly for high-frequency components. In real 2p recordings from sensorimotor areas in mice performing a {\textquotedblleft}water grab{\textquotedblright} task, RADICaL infers network state with close correspondence to single-trial variations in behavior, and maintains high-quality inference even when neuronal populations are substantially reduced.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Our generative model takes a deep temporal form, combining both discrete and continuous states. This allows a (synthetic) WORM agent to perform categorical inference on continuous acoustic signals, and{\textemdash}based on the same model{\textemdash}to repeat heard words at the appropriate time. From the perspective of word production, the model simulates how high-level beliefs about discrete lexical, prosodic and context attributes give rise to continuous acoustic signals at the sensory level. From the perspective of word recognition, it simulates how continuous acoustic signals are recognised as words and, how (and when) they should be repeated. We establish the face validity of our generative model by simulating a word repetition paradigm in which a synthetic agent or a human subject hears a target word and subsequently reproduces that word. The repeated word should be the target word but differs acoustically. The results of these simulations reveal how the generative model correctly infers what must be repeated, to the extent it can successfully interact with a human subject. This provides a formal process theory of auditory perception and production that can be deployed in health and disease. We conclude with a discussion of how the generative model could be scaled-up to include a larger phonetic and phonotactic repertoire, complex higher-level attributes (e.g., semantic, concepts, etc.), and produce more elaborate exchanges.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

A total of 464 current-clamp experiments from identified excitatory and inhibitory neurons are provided.

All experiments follow a within neuron across drug design which includes a vehicle control and a modulation of one of the following targets in the same neuron: dopamine and its receptors D1R, D2R, serotonin 5HT1f receptor, norepinephrine Alpha1, and acetylcholine M1 receptors.Conclusions This dataset is the first to provide a systematic and comparative insight into the role of the selected neuromodulators in controlling cellular excitability.

	abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy of Ca2+ transients in small neurites of the behaving mouse provides an unprecedented view of the micrometer-scale mechanisms supporting neuronal communication and computation, and therefore opens the way to understanding their role in cognition. However, the exploitation of this growing and precious experimental data is impeded by the scarcity of methods dedicated to the analysis of images of neurites activity in vivo. We present NNeurite, a set of mathematical and computational techniques specialized for the analysis of time-lapse microscopy images of neurite activity in small behaving animals. Starting from noisy and unstable microscopy images containing an unknown number of small neurites, NNeurite simultaneously aligns images, denoises signals and extracts the location and the temporal activity of the sources of Ca2+ transients. At the core of NNeurite is a novel artificial neuronal network (NN) which we have specifically designed to solve the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problem modeling source separation in fluorescence microscopy images. For the first time, we have embedded non-rigid image alignment in the NMF optimization procedure, hence allowing to stabilize images based on the transient and weak neurite signals. NNeurite processing is free of any human intervention as NN training is unsupervised and the unknown number of Ca2+ sources is automatically obtained by the NN-based computation of a low-dimensional representation of time-lapse images. Importantly, the spatial shapes of the sources of Ca2+ fluorescence are not constrained in NNeurite, which allowed to automatically extract the micrometer-scale details of dendritic and axonal branches, such dendritic spines and synaptic boutons, in the cortex of behaving mice. We provide NNeurite as a free and open-source library to support the efforts of the community in advancing in vivo microscopy of neurite activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Information from the sensory periphery is conveyed to the cortex via structured projection pathways that spatially segregate stimulus features, providing a robust and efficient encoding strategy. Beyond sensory encoding, this prominent anatomical feature extends throughout the neocortex. However, the extent to which it influences cortical processing is unclear. In this study, we combine cortical circuit modeling with network theory to demonstrate that the sharpness of topographic projections acts as a bifurcation parameter, controlling the macroscopic dynamics and representational precision across a modular network. By shifting the balance of excitation and inhibition, topographic modularity gradually increases task performance and improves the signal-to-noise ratio across the system. We demonstrate that in biologically constrained networks, such a denoising behavior is contingent on recurrent inhibition. We show that this is a robust and generic structural feature that enables a broad range of behaviorally-relevant operating regimes, and provide an in-depth theoretical analysis unravelling the dynamical principles underlying the mechanism.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Although over 1{\textquoteright}500 proteins are associated with RNAs in human cells, their binding motifs, targets and functions still remain to be elucidated, especially in the complex environment of human tissues and in the context of diseases. To overcome the lack of methods for systematic and automated detection of sequence motif-guided changes in pre-mRNA processing based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data we have developed MAPP (Motif Activity on Pre-mRNA Processing). We demonstrate MAPP{\textquoteright}s functionality by applying it to RNA-seq data from 284 RBP knock-down experiments in the ENCODE project, from which MAPP not only infers position-dependent impact profiles of known regulators, but also reveals RBPs that modulate both the inclusion of cassette exons and the poly(A) site choice. Among these, the Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 (PTBP1) has a similar activity in glioblastoma samples. This highlights the ability of MAPP to unveil global regulators of mRNA processing under physiological and pathological conditions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {To accurately predict rewards associated with states or actions, the variability of observations has to be taken into account. In particular, when the observations are noisy, the individual rewards should have less influence on tracking of average reward, and the estimate of the mean reward should be updated to a smaller extent after each observation. However, it is not known how the magnitude of the observation noise might be tracked and used to control prediction updates in the brain reward system. Here, we introduce a new model that uses simple, tractable learning rules that track the mean and standard deviation of reward, and leverages prediction errors scaled by uncertainty as the central feedback signal. We provide a normative analysis, comparing the performance of the new model with that of conventional models in a value tracking task. We find that the new model has an advantage over conventional models when tested across various levels of observation noise. Further, we propose a possible biological implementation of the model in the basal ganglia circuit. The scaled prediction error feedback signal is consistent with experimental findings concerning dopamine prediction error scaling relative to reward magnitude, and the update rules are found to be consistent with many features of striatal plasticity. Our results span across the levels of implementation, algorithm, and computation, and might have important implications for understanding the dopaminergic prediction error signal and its relation to adaptive and effective learning.Author Summary The basal ganglia system is a collection of subcortical nuclei in the mammalian brain. This system and its dopaminergic inputs are associated with learning from rewards. Here, dopamine is thought to signal errors in reward prediction. The structure and function of the basal ganglia system are not fully understood yet{\textemdash}for example, the basal ganglia are split into two antagonistic pathways, but the reason for this split and the role of the two pathways are unknown. Further, it has been found that under some circumstances, rewards of different sizes lead to dopamine responses of similar size, which cannot be explained with the reward prediction error theory. Here, we propose a new model of learning in the basal ganglia{\textemdash}the scaled prediction error model. According to our model, both reward average and reward uncertainty are tracked and represented in the two basal ganglia pathways. The learned reward uncertainty is then used to scale dopaminergic reward prediction errors, which effectively renders learning adaptive to reward noise. We show that such learning is more robust than learning from unscaled prediction errors and that it explains several physiological features of the basal ganglia system.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Yet, the specific neural mechanisms underlying the effects of spatial attention on performance are still contested. Here, we examine different attention mechanisms in spiking deep convolutional neural networks. We directly contrast effects of precision (internal noise suppression) and two different gain modulation mechanisms on performance on a visual search task with complex real-world images. Unlike standard artificial neurons, biological neurons have saturating activation functions, permitting implementation of attentional gain as gain on a neuron{\textquoteright}s input or on its outgoing connection. We show that modulating the connection is most effective in selectively enhancing information processing by redistributing spiking activity, and by introducing additional task-relevant information, as shown by representational similarity analyses. Precision only produced minor attentional effects in performance. Our results, which mirror empirical findings, show that it is possible to adjudicate between attention mechanisms using more biologically realistic models and natural stimuli.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, research on somatosensory perception has led to two important observations. First, self-generated touches that are predicted by voluntary movements become attenuated compared to externally generated touches of the same intensity (attenuation). Second, externally generated touches feel weaker and are more difficult to detect during movement than at rest (gating). Currently, researchers often consider gating and attenuation the same suppression process; however, this assumption is unwarranted because, despite more than forty years of research, no study has combined them in a single paradigm. We quantified how people perceive self-generated and externally generated touches during movement and rest. We show that whereas voluntary movement gates the precision of both self-generated and externally generated touch, the amplitude of self-generated touch is robustly attenuated compared to externally generated touch. Furthermore, attenuation and gating do not interact and are not correlated, and we conclude that they represent distinct perceptual phenomena.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Based on neuroimaging data, the insula is considered important for people to empathize with the pain of others, whether that pain is perceived through facial expressions or the sight of limbs in painful situations. Here we present the first report of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings from the insulae collected while 7 presurgical epilepsy patients rated the intensity of a woman{\textquoteright}s painful experiences viewed in movies. In two separate conditions, pain was deduced from seeing facial expressions or a hand being slapped by a belt. We found that broadband activity in the 20-190 Hz range correlated with the trial-by-trial perceived intensity in the insula for both types of stimuli. Using microwires at the tip of a selection of the electrodes, we additionally isolated 8 insular neurons with spiking that correlated with perceived intensity. Within the insula, we found a patchwork of locations with differing selectivities within our stimulus set, some representing intensity only for facial expressions, others only for the hand being hit, and others for both. That we found some locations with intensity coding only for faces, and others only for hand across simultaneously recorded locations suggests that insular activity while witnessing the pain of others cannot be entirely reduced to a univariate salience representation. Psychophysics and the temporal properties of our signals indicate that the timing of responses encoding intensity for the sight of the hand being hit are best explained by kinematic information; the timing of those encoding intensity for facial expressions are best explained by shape information in the face. In particular, the furrowing of the eyebrows and the narrowing of the eyes of the protagonist in the movies suffice to predict both the rating of and the timing of the neuronal response to the facial expressions. Comparing the broadband activity in the iEEG signal with spiking activity and an fMRI experiment with similar stimuli revealed a consistent spatial organization for the representation of intensity from our hand stimuli, with stronger intensity representation more anteriorly and around neurons with intensity coding. In contrast, for the facial expressions, we found that the activity at the three levels of measurement do not coincide, suggesting a more disorganized representation. Together, our intracranial recordings indicate that the insula encodes, in a partially intermixed layout, both static and dynamic cues from different body parts that reflect the intensity of pain experienced by others.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.BA44/45Brodmann Area 44/45BBPBroad-Band Power 20-190 HzBF10Bayes Factor in favour of a two-tailed alternative hypothesisBF01Bayes Factor in favour of the null hypothesis relative to the two-tailed alternative hypothesisBF+0Bayes Factor in favour of a one-tailed alternative hypothesisFp1Frontal pole region 1iEEGintracranial EEGMNIMontreal Neurological Institute coordinate systemOP8/9Frontal Opercular regions 8 and 9p1one-tailed p-valuep2two-tailed p-valuerPPearson{\textquoteright}s correlation coefficientrSSpearman{\textquoteright}s rank correlation coefficientrKKendall{\textquoteright}s Tau correlation coefficient.},

	abstract = {The brain continuously coordinates skeletomuscular movements with internal physiological states like arousal, but how is this coordination achieved? One possibility is that brain simply reacts to changes in external and/or internal signals. Another possibility is that it is actively coordinating both external and internal activities. We used functional ultrasound imaging to capture a large medial section of the brain, including multiple cortical and subcortical areas, in marmoset monkeys while monitoring their spontaneous movements and cardiac activity. By analyzing the causal ordering of these different time-series, we found that information flowing from the brain to movements and heart rate fluctuations were significantly greater than in the opposite direction. The brain areas involved in this external versus internal coordination were spatially distinct but also extensively interconnected. Temporally, the brain alternated between network states for this regulation.

Here, we combine multiplexed transcriptional and protein measurements at population and single-cell levels with multivariate statistical modeling to show that the state of AP-1 transcription factor network plays a unifying role in explaining diverse patterns of plasticity in melanoma. We find that a regulated balance between AP-1 factors cJUN, JUND, FRA2, FRA1 and cFOS determines the intrinsic diversity of differentiation states and adaptive responses to MAPK inhibitors in melanoma cells. Perturbing this balance through genetic depletion of specific AP-1 proteins, or by MAPK inhibitors, shifts cellular heterogeneity in a predictable fashion. Thus, AP-1 may serve as a critical node for manipulating cellular plasticity with potential therapeutic implications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging research on anxiety has traditionally focused on brain networks associated with the psychological aspects of anxiety. Here, instead, we target the somatic aspects of anxiety. Motivated by the growing appreciation that top-down cortical processing plays a crucial role in perception and action, we used resting-state functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to characterize effective connectivity among hierarchically organized regions in the exteroceptive, interoceptive, and motor cortices. In people with high (fear-related) somatic arousal, top-down effective connectivity was enhanced in all three networks: an observation that corroborates well with the phenomenology of anxiety. The anxiety-associated changes in connectivity were sufficiently reliable to predict whether a new participant has mild or severe somatic anxiety. Interestingly, the increase in top-down connections to sensorimotor cortex were not associated with fear affect scores, thus establishing the (relative) dissociation between somatic and cognitive dimensions of anxiety. Overall, enhanced top-down effective connectivity in sensorimotor cortices emerges as a promising and quantifiable candidate marker of trait somatic anxiety.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The illusory sense of body-ownership has been studied since the publication of the rubber hand illusion, where ambiguous body ownership feeling, expressed as {\textquotedblleft}the dummy hand is my hand even though that is not true{\textquotedblright}, was first defined. Phenomenologically, the ambiguous body ownership is attributed to a conflict between feeling and judgement; in other words, it characterises a discrepancy between first-person (i.e. bottom-up) and third-person (i.e. top-down) processes. Although Bayesian inference can explain this malleability of body image sufficiently, the theory does not provide a good illustration of why we have different experiences to the same stimuli {\textendash} the difficulty lies in the uncertainty regarding the concept of judgement in their theory.This study attempts to explain subjective experience during rubber hand illusions using integrated information theory (IIT). The integrated information Φ in IIT measures the difference between the entire system and its subsystems. This concept agrees with the phenomenological interpretation {\textendash} that is, there is conflict between judgement and feeling. By analysing the seven nodes of a small body{\textendash} brain system, we demonstrate that the integrity of the entire system during the illusion decreases with increasing integrity of its subsystems. These general tendencies agree well with many brain-image analyses and subjective reports; furthermore, we found that subjective ratings were associated with the Φs. Our result suggests that IIT can explain the general tendency of the sense of ownership illusions and individual differences in subjective experience during the illusions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In this fMRI study, we examined the neural basis of anxiety and anxiety-related autonomic responses in a daily driving situation. Participants viewed a driving video clip in the first-person perspective. During the video clip, participants were presented with a cue to indicate whether a subsequent crash could occur (attention condition) or not (safe condition). Enhanced activities in the anterior insula, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, and higher sympathetic nerve responses (pupil dilation and peripheral arterial stiffness) were triggered by the attention condition but not with the safe condition. Autonomic response-related functional connectivity was detected in the visual cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, and MCC/PCC with the right anterior insula and its adjacent regions as seed regions. Thus, the right anterior insula and adjacent regions, in collaboration with other regions play a role in eliciting anxiety based on the prediction of negative events, by mediating anxiety-related autonomic responses according to interoceptive information.Competing Interest StatementDS, NM, HY, and MT are employed by Mazda Motor Corporation.

	abstract = {From decision making to perception to language, predicting what is coming next is crucial. It is also challenging in stochastic, changing, and structured environments; yet the brain makes accurate predictions in many situations. What computational architecture could enable this feat? Bayesian inference makes optimal predictions but is prohibitively difficult to compute. Here, we show that a specific recurrent neural network architecture enables simple and accurate solutions in several environments. This architecture relies on three mechanisms: gating, lateral connections, and recurrent weight training. Like the optimal solution and the human brain, such networks develop internal representations of their changing environment (including estimates of the environment{\textquoteright}s latent variables and the precision of these estimates), leverage multiple levels of latent structure, and adapt their effective learning rate to changes without changing their connection weights. Being ubiquitous in the brain, gated recurrence could therefore serve as a generic building block to predict in real-life environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a pathological condition characterized by impaired motor skills. Current theories advance that a deficit of the internal models is mainly responsible for DCD children{\textquoteright}s altered behavior. Yet, accurate movement execution requires not only correct movement planning, but also integration of sensory feedback into body representation for action (Body Schema) to update the state of the body. Here we advance and test the hypothesis that the plasticity of this body representation is altered in DCD. To probe Body Schema (BS) plasticity, we submitted a well-established tool-use paradigm to seventeen DCD children, required to reach for an object with their hand before and after tool use, and compared their movement kinematics to that of a control group of Typically Developing (TD) peers. We also asked both groups to provide explicit estimates of their arm length to probe plasticity of their Body Image (BI). Results revealed that DCD children explicitly judged their arm shorter after tool use, showing changes in their BI comparable to their TD peers. Unlike them, though, DCD did not update their implicit BS estimate: kinematics showed that tool use affected their peak amplitudes, but not their latencies. Remarkably, the kinematics of tool use showed that the motor control of the tool was comparable between groups, both improving with practice, confirming that motor learning abilities are preserved in DCD. This study thus brings evidence in favor of an alternative theoretical account of the DCD etiology. Our findings point to a deficit in the plasticity of the body representation used to plan and execute movements. Though not mutually exclusive, this widens the theoretical perspective under which DCD should be considered: DCD may not be limited to a problem affecting the internal models and their motor functions, but may concern the state of the effector they have to use.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The perception of our body in space is flexible and manipulable. The predictive brain hypothesis explains this malleability as a consequence of the interplay between incoming sensory information and our body expectations. However, given the interaction between perception and action, we might also expect that actions would arise due to prediction errors, especially in conflicting situations. Here we describe a computational model, based on the free-energy principle, that forecasts involuntary movements in sensorimotor conflicts. We experimentally confirm those predictions in humans using a virtual reality rubber-hand illusion. Participants generated movements (forces) towards the virtual hand, regardless of its location with respect to the real arm, with little to no forces produced when the virtual hand overlaid their physical hand. The congruency of our model predictions and human observations indicates that the brain-body is generating actions to reduce the prediction error between the expected arm location and the new visual arm. This observed unconscious mechanism is an empirical validation of the perception-action duality in body adaptation to uncertain situations and evidence of the active component of predictive processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Theoretical accounts have ascribed such misperceptions to local interactions in peripheral and primary somatosensory neurons, positing that spatial-perceptual mechanisms adhere to limb boundaries and skin layout.

On their trajectories, objects often touch multiple limbs; therefore, body-environment interactions should manifest in perceptual mechanisms that reflect external space.Here, we demonstrate that humans perceived the cutaneous rabbit illusion {\textendash} the percept of multiple identical stimuli as hopping across the skin {\textendash} along the Euclidian trajectory between stimuli on two body parts and regularly mislocalized stimuli from one limb to the other.

	abstract = {Lesion inference analysis is a fundamental approach for characterizing the causal contributions of neural elements to brain function. Historically, it has helped to localize specialized functions in the brain after brain damage, and it has gained new prominence through the arrival of modern optogenetic perturbation techniques that allow probing the functional contributions of neural circuit elements at unprecedented levels of detail.While inferences drawn from brain lesions are conceptually powerful, they face methodological difficulties due to the brain{\textquoteright}s complexity. Particularly, they are challenged to disentangle the functional contributions of individual neural elements because many elements may contribute to a particular function, and these elements may be interacting anatomically as well as functionally. Therefore, studies of real-world data, as in clinical lesion studies, are not suitable for establishing the reliability of lesion approaches due to an unknown, potentially complex ground truth. Instead, ground truth studies of well-characterized artificial systems are required.Here, we systematically and exhaustively lesioned a small Artificial Neural Network (ANN) playing a classic arcade game. We determined the functional contributions of all nodes and links, contrasting results from single-element perturbations and perturbing multiple elements simultaneously. Moreover, we computed pairwise causal functional interactions between the network elements, and looked deeper into the system{\textquoteright}s inner workings, proposing a mechanistic explanation for the effects of lesions.We found that not every perturbation necessarily reveals causation, as lesioning elements, one at a time, produced biased results. By contrast, multi-site lesion analysis captured crucial details that were missed by single-site lesions. We conclude that even small and seemingly simple ANNs show surprising complexity that needs to be understood for deriving a causal picture of the system. In the context of rapidly evolving multivariate brain-mapping approaches and inference methods, we advocate using in-silico experiments and ground-truth models to verify fundamental assumptions, technical limitations, and the scope of possible interpretations of these methods.Author summary The motto {\textquotedblleft}No causation without manipulation{\textquotedblright} is canonical to scientific endeavors. In particular, neuroscience seeks to find which brain elements are causally involved in cognition and behavior of interest by perturbing them. However, due to complex interactions among those elements, this goal has remained challenging.In this paper, we used an Artificial Neural Network as a ground-truth model to compare the inferential capacities of lesioning the system one element at a time against sampling from the set of all possible combinations of lesions.We argue for employing more exhaustive perturbation regimes since, as we show, lesioning one element at a time provides misleading results. We further advocate using simulated experiments and ground-truth models to verify the assumptions and limitations of brain-mapping methods.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Surprising events trigger measurable brain activity and influence human behavior by affecting learning, memory, and decision-making. Currently there is, however, no consensus on the definition of surprise. Here we identify 16 mathematical definitions of surprise in a unifying framework, show how these definitions relate to each other, and prove under what conditions they are indistinguishable. We classify these surprise measures into four main categories: (i) change-point detection surprise, (ii) information gain surprise, (iii) prediction surprise, and (iv) confidence-correction surprise. We design experimental paradigms where different categories make different predictions: we show that surprise-modulation of the speed of learning leads to sensible adaptive behavior only for change-point detection surprise whereas surprise-seeking leads to sensible exploration strategies only for information gain surprise. However, since neither change-point detection surprise nor information gain surprise perfectly reflect the definition of {\textquoteleft}surprise{\textquoteright} in natural language, a combination of prediction surprise and confidence-correction surprise is needed to capture intuitive aspects of surprise perception. We formalize this combination in a new definition of surprise with testable experimental predictions. We conclude that there cannot be a single surprise measure with all functions and properties previously attributed to surprise. Consequently, we postulate that multiple neural mechanisms exist to detect and signal different aspects of surprise.Author note AM is grateful to Vasiliki Liakoni, Martin Barry, and Valentin Schmutz for many useful discussions in the course of the last few years, and to Andrew Barto for insightful discussions through and after EPFL Neuro Symposium 2021 on {\textquotedblleft}Surprise, Curiosity and Reward: from Neuroscience to AI{\textquotedblright}.

Here we report that juvenile rats as compared to adults exhibit impulsive and compulsive-like behavioral traits, the latter being associated with lower expression of mRNA levels of the immediate early gene zif268 in the anterior insula (AI). This observation suggests that deficits in AI function in juvenile rats could explain their immature pattern of interoceptive cue integration in rational decision-making and compulsive phenotype. In support of this, here we report hypoexcitability of juvenile layer-V pyramidal neurons in the AI, concomitant with reduced glutamatergic synaptic input to these cells. Chemogenetic activation of the AI attenuated the compulsive trait suggesting that delayed maturation of the AI results in suboptimal integration of sensory and cognitive information in adolescents and this contributes to inflexible behaviors in specific conditions of reward availability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Predictive processing is emerging as a common computational hypothesis to account for diverse psychological functions subserved by a brain, providing a systems-level framework for characterizing structure-function relationships of its distinct substructures. Here, we contribute to this framework by examining gradients of functional connectivity as a low dimensional spatial representation of functional variation in the brain and demonstrating their computational implications for predictive processing. Specifically, we investigated functional connectivity gradients in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus using resting-state functional MRI data collected from large samples of healthy young adults. We then evaluated the degree to which these structures share common principles of functional organization by assessing the correspondence of their gradients. We show that the organizing principles of these structures primarily follow two functional gradients consistent with the existing hierarchical accounts of predictive processing: A model-error gradient that describes the flow of prediction and prediction error signals, and a model-precision gradient that differentiates regions involved in the representation and attentional modulation of such signals in the cerebral cortex. Using these gradients, we also demonstrated triangulation of functional connectivity involving distinct subregions of the three structures, which allows characterization of distinct ways in which these structures functionally interact with each other, possibly subserving unique and complementary aspects of predictive processing. These findings support the viability of computational hypotheses about the functional relationships between the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus that may be instrumental for understanding the brain{\textquoteright}s dynamics within its large-scale predictive architecture.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Gambling disorder is associated with increased temporal discounting and reduced model-based learning. Regular gamblers (n = 30, DSM-5 score range 3-9) performed both tasks in a neutral (caf{\'e}) and a gambling-related environment (slot-machine venue) in counterbalanced order. Data were modeled using drift diffusion models for temporal discounting and reinforcement learning via hierarchical Bayesian estimation. Replicating previous findings, gamblers discounted rewards more steeply in the gambling-related context. This effect was positively correlated with gambling related cognitive distortions (pre-registered analysis). In contrast to our pre-registered hypothesis, model-based reinforcement learning was improved in the gambling context. Here we show that temporal discounting and model-based reinforcement learning are modulated in opposite ways by real-life gambling cue exposure. Results challenge aspects of habit theories of addiction, and reveal that laboratory-based computational markers of psychopathology are under substantial contextual control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we investigated whether female rats escalate self-administration of methylone, 3,4-methylenedioxypentedrone (pentylone), and MDMA and then studied consequences of MDMA and pentylone self-administration on GABAA receptor and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a brain area critically dysregulated by extended access self-administration of alcohol or cocaine. Adult female Wistar rats were trained to self-administer methylone, pentylone, MDMA (0.5 mg/kg/infusion), or saline-vehicle using a fixed-ratio 1 response contingency in 6-hour sessions (long-access: LgA) followed by progressive ratio (PR) dose-response testing. The effects of pentylone-LgA, MDMA-LgA and saline on basal GABAergic transmission (miniature postsynaptic inhibitory currents, mIPSCs) and the modulatory role of KOR at CeA GABAergic synapses were determined in acute brain slices using whole-cell patch-clamp. Methylone-LgA and pentylone-LgA rats similarly escalated their drug intake (both obtained more infusions compared to MDMA-LgA rats) however, pentylone-LgA rats reached higher breakpoints in PR tests. At the cellular level, baseline CeA GABA transmission was markedly elevated in pentylone-LgA and MDMA-LgA rats compared to saline-vehicle. Specifically, pentylone-LgA was associated with increased CeA mIPSC frequency (GABA release) and amplitude (postsynaptic GABAA receptor function), while mIPSC amplitudes (but not frequency) was larger in MDMA-LgA rats compared to saline rats. In addition, pentylone-LgA and MDMA-LgA profoundly disrupted CeA KOR signaling such as both KOR agonism (1mM U50488) and KOR antagonism (200nM nor-binaltorphimine) decreased mIPSC frequency suggesting recruitment of non-canonical KOR signaling pathways. This study confirms escalated self-administration of entactogen psychostimulants under LgA conditions in female rats which is accompanied by increased CeA GABAergic inhibition and altered KOR signaling. Collectively, our study suggests that CeA GABA and KOR mechanisms play a critical role in entactogen self-administration like those observed with escalation of alcohol or cocaine self-administration.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Scene construction is a key component of memory recall, navigation, and future imagining, and relies on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). A parallel body of work suggests that eye movements may enable the imagination and construction of scenes, even in the absence of external visual input. There are vast structural and functional connections between regions of the MTL and those of the oculomotor system. However, the directionality of connections between the MTL and oculomotor control regions, and how it relates to scene construction, has not been studied directly in human neuroimaging. In the current study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to interrogate effective connectivity between the MTL and oculomotor regions using a scene construction task in which participants{\textquoteright} eye movements were either restricted (fixed-viewing) or unrestricted (free-viewing). By omitting external visual input, and by contrasting free- versus fixed- viewing, the directionality of neural connectivity during scene construction could be determined. As opposed to when eye movements were restricted, allowing free viewing during construction of scenes strengthened top-down connections from the MTL to the frontal eye fields, and to lower-level cortical visual processing regions, suppressed bottom-up connections along the visual stream, and enhanced vividness of the constructed scenes. Taken together, these findings provide novel, non-invasive evidence for the causal architecture between the MTL memory system and oculomotor system associated with constructing vivid mental representations of scenes.HighlightsThe role of eye movements in mentally constructing scene imagery was investigatedRestricting eye movements impaired vividness of constructed scene imageryMaking eye movements strengthened connectivity from memory to oculomotor regionsCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {While the brain regions involved in action observation are relatively well documented in humans and primates, how these regions communicate to help understand and predict actions remains poorly understood. Traditional views emphasized a feed-forward architecture in which visual features are organized into increasingly complex representations that feed onto motor programs in parietal and then premotor cortices where the matching of observed actions upon the observer{\textquoteright}s own motor programs contributes to action understanding. Predictive coding models place less emphasis on feed-forward connections and propose that feed-back connections from premotor regions back to parietal and visual neurons represent predictions about upcoming actions that can supersede visual inputs when actions become predictable, with visual input then merely representing prediction errors. Here we leverage the notion that feed-back connections target specific cortical layers to help adjudicate across these views. Specifically, we test whether observing sequences of hand actions in their natural order, which permits participants to predict upcoming actions, triggers more feed-back input to parietal regions than seeing the same actions in a scrambled sequence that hinders making predictions. Using submillimeter fMRI acquisition at 7T, we find that watching predictable sequences triggers more action-related activity (as measured using intersubject functional correlation) in the parietal cortical area PFt at depths receiving feed-back connections (layers III and V/VI) than watching the exact same actions in scrambled and hence unpredictable sequence. In addition, functional connectivity analysis performed using intersubject functional connectivity confirms that these increased action-related signals in PFt could originate from ventral premotor region BA44. This data showcases the utility of intersubject functional correlation in combination with 7T MRI to explore the architecture of social cognition under more naturalistic conditions, and provides evidence for models that emphasize the importance of feed-back connections in action prediction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {This study demonstrates the functional importance of the Surround context relayed laterally in V1 by the horizontal connectivity, in controlling the latency and the gain of the cortical response to the feedforward visual drive. We report here four main findings : 1) a centripetal apparent motion sequence results in a shortening of the spiking latency of V1 cells, when the orientation of the local inducer and the global motion axis are both co-aligned with the RF orientation preference; 2) this contextual effects grows with visual flow speed, peaking at 150-250{\textdegree}/s when it matches the propagation speed of horizontal connectivity (0.15-0.25 mm/ms); 3) For this speed range, the axial sensitivity of V1 cells is tilted by 90{\textdegree} to become co-aligned with the orientation preference axis; 4) the strength of modulation by the surround context correlates with the spatiotemporal coherence of the apparent motion flow. Our results suggest an internally-generated binding process, linking local (orientation /position) and global (motion/direction) features as early as V1. This long-range diffusion process constitutes a plausible substrate in V1 of the human psychophysical bias in speed estimation for collinear motion. Since it is demonstrated in the anesthetized cat, this novel form of contextual control of the cortical gain and phase is a built-in property in V1, whose expression does not require behavioral attention and top-down control from higher cortical areas. We propose that horizontal connectivity participates in the propagation of an internal {\textquotedblleft}prediction{\textquotedblright} wave, shaped by visual experience, which links contour co-alignment and global axial motion at an apparent speed in the range of saccade-like eye-movements.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) can differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts, and are important regulators of the haematopoietic system. Ageing associates with an increased ratio of bone marrow adipocytes to osteoblasts and immune dysregulation. Here, we carried out an integrative multiomics analysis of ATAC-Seq, RNA-Seq and proteomics data from primary human BMSCs in a healthy cohort age between 20 - 60. We identified age-sensitive elements uniquely affecting each molecular level where transcription is mostly spared, and characterised the underlying biological pathways, revealing the interplay of age-related gene expression mechanism changes spanning multiple gene regulatory layers. Through data integration with enhancer-mediated gene regulatory network analysis, we discovered that enhancers and transcription factors influence cell differentiation potential in the ageing BMSCs. By combining our results with genome-wide association study data, we found that age-specific changes could contribute to common traits related to BMSC-derived tissues such as bone and adipose tissue, and to immune-related traits on a systemic level such as asthma. We demonstrate here that a multiomics approach is crucial for unravelling complex information, providing new insights on how ageing contributes to bone marrow- and immune-related disorders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Both imagery and execution of motor controls consist of interactions within a neuronal network, including frontal motor-related regions and posterior parietal regions. To reveal neural representation in the frontoparietal motor network, two approaches have been proposed thus far: one is decoding of actions/modes related to motor control from the spatial pattern of brain activity; another is to estimate directed functional connectivity, which means a directed association between two brain regions within motor regions. However, directed connectivity among multiple regions of the motor network during motor imagery (MI) or motor execution (ME) has not been investigated. Here, we attempted to characterize the directed functional connectivity within the frontoparietal motor-related networks between the MI and ME conditions. We developed a delayed sequential movement and imagery task to evoke brain activity associated with data under ME and MI via functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. We applied a causal discovery approach, linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal model, to identify directed functional connectivity among the frontoparietal motor-related brain regions for each condition. We demonstrated higher directed functional connectivity from the contralateral dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) to the primary motor cortex (M1) in ME than in MI. We mainly identified significant direct effects of the dPMC and ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) to the parietal regions. In particular, connectivity from the dPMC to the superior parietal lobule in the same hemisphere showed significant positive effects across all conditions. Contrastingly, interlateral connectivities from the vPMC to the superior parietal lobule showed significantly negative effects across all conditions. Finally, we found positive effects from A1 to M1 in the same hemisphere, such as the audio-motor pathway. These results indicated that the sources of motor command originated in d/vPMC influenced M1 and parietal regions as achieving ME and MI. Additionally, sequential sounds may functionally facilitate temporal motor processes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

While interoception spans sensory to metacognitive processing, it is not clear whether anxiety is differentially related to these processing levels. Here we investigated this question in the domain of breathing, using computational modelling and high-field (7 Tesla) fMRI to assess brain activity relating to dynamic changes in inspiratory resistance of varying predictability. Notably, the anterior insula was associated with both breathing-related prediction certainty and prediction errors, suggesting an important role in representing and updating models of the body. Individuals with low vs. moderate anxiety traits showed differential anterior insula activity for prediction certainty. Multimodal analyses of data from fMRI, computational assessments of breathing-related metacognition, and questionnaires demonstrated that anxiety-interoception links span all levels from perceptual sensitivity to metacognition, with strong effects seen at higher levels of interoceptive processes.Competing Interest StatementFV been invited to scientific meetings, consulted and/or served as speaker and received compensation by Lundbeck, Servier, Recordati, Janssen, Otsuka, LivaNova and Chiesi.

	abstract = {Rodents use whisking to probe actively their environment and to locate objects in space, hence providing a paradigmatic biological example of active sensing. Numerous studies show that the control of whisking has anticipatory aspects. For example, rodents target their whisker protraction to the distance at which they expect objects, rather than just reacting fast to contacts with unexpected objects. Here we characterize the anticipatory control of whisking in rodents as an active inference process. In this perspective, the rodent is endowed with a prior belief that it will touch something at the end of the whisker protraction, and it continuously modulates its whisking amplitude to minimize (proprioceptive and somatosensory) prediction errors arising from an unexpected whisker-object contact, or from a lack of an expected contact. We will use the model to qualitatively reproduce key empirical findings about the ways rodents modulate their whisker amplitude during exploration and the scanning of (expected or unexpected) objects. Furthermore, we will discuss how the components of active inference model can in principle map to the neurobiological circuits of rodent whisking.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Seminal studies on human cognitive behavior have been conducted in controlled laboratory settings, demonstrating that visual attention is mainly goal-directed and allocated based on the action performed. However, it is unclear how far these results generalize to cognition in more naturalistic settings. The present study investigates active inference processes revealed by eye movements during interaction with familiar and novel tools with two levels of realism of the action affordance. We presented participants with 3D tool models that were either familiar or unfamiliar, oriented congruent or incongruent to their handedness, and asked participants to interact with them by lifting or using. Importantly, we used the same experimental design in two setups. In the first experiment, participants interacted with a VR controller in a low realism environment; in the second, they performed the task with an interaction setup that allowed differentiated hand and finger movements in a high realism environment. We investigated the differences in odds of fixations and their eccentricity towards the tool parts before action initiation. The results show that participants fixate more on the tool{\textquoteright}s effector part before action initiation for the use task for unfamiliar tools. Furthermore, with more realistic action affordances, subjects fixate more on the tool{\textquoteright}s handle as a function of the tool{\textquoteright}s orientation, well before the action was executed. Secondly, the spatial viewing bias on the tool reveals early fixations are influenced by the task and the familiarity of the tools. In contrast, later fixations are associated with the manual planning of the interaction. In sum, the findings from the experiments suggest that fixations are made in a task-oriented way to plan the intended action well before action initiation. Further, with more realistic action affordances, fixations are made towards the proximal goal of optimally planning the grasp even though the perceived action on the tools is identical for both experimental setups. Taken together, proximal and distal goal-oriented planning is contextualized to the realism of action/interaction afforded by an environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We systematically demonstrate that accurate fear prediction crucially requires distributed brain systems, with important contributions from cortical (e.g., prefrontal, midcingulate and insular cortices) and subcortical (e.g., thalamus, periaqueductal gray, basal forebrain and amygdala) regions. We further demonstrate that the neural representation of subjective fear is distinguishable from the representation of conditioned threat and general negative affect. Overall, our findings suggest that subjective fear, which exhibits distinct neural representation with some other aversive states, is encoded in distributed systems rather than isolated {\textquoteleft}fear centers{\textquoteright}. This signature provides a neuromarker for monitoring fear-related neuropathology and evaluating novel treatments targeting pathological fear.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The lack of data on emotion with the ecologically valid naturalistic paradigm hinders the knowledge of emotion mechanism in a real-world interaction. To this aim, we collected the emotional multimedia clips, validated them with the university students, recorded the neuro-physiological activities and self-assessment ratings for these stimuli. Participants localized their emotional feelings (in time) and were free to choose the best emotion for describing their feelings with minimum distractions and cognitive load. The obtained electrophysiological and self-assessment responses were analyzed with functional connectivity, machine learning and source localization techniques. We observed that the connectivity patterns in the theta and beta band could differentiate emotions better. Using machine learning, we observed that the classification of affective self-assessment features, namely dominance, familiarity, and self-relevance, involves midline brain regions responsible for mentalization and event construction activity compared to valence and arousal, which were mainly associated with lateral brain regions. This finding advocates the need for more than two dimensions for emotion representation. In addition, the channels with high predictability were source localized to the brain regions in default-mode, sensorimotor and salience networks. Hence, in this naturalistic study, we find that the domain-general systems contribute to emotion construction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Emotion experiments with naturalistic paradigms are emerging and giving new insights into dynamic brain activity. Context familiarity is considered as an important dimensions of emotion processing by appraisal theorists. However, how the context un/familiarity of the naturalistic stimuli influences the central and autonomic activity is not probed yet [check it]. Hence, we tried to address this issue in this work by breaking it down into three questions. 1) What is the relation between context un/familiarity with the neural correlates of self-assessment affective dimensions viz. valence and arousal; 2) the influence of context un/familiarity in cardiac-brain mutual interaction during emotion processing; 3.) brain network reorganization to accommodate the degree of context familiarity. We found that the less-context familiarity is primarily attributed to negative emotion feeling mediated by lack of predictability of sensory experience. Whereas, with high-context familiarity, both positive and negative emotions are felt. For less-context familiarity, the arousal activity is negatively correlated with EEG power. In addition, the cardiac activity for both high and less context familiarity is modulated before the reported self-awareness of emotional feeling. The correlation of cortical regions with cardiac activity and connectivity patterns reveals that ECG is modulated by salient feature during pre-awareness and correlates with AIC and conceptual hub in high-familiarity. Whereas, for the low familiarity, the cardiac activity is correlated with the exteroceptive sensory regions. In addition, we found that OFC and dmPFC have high connectivity with less-context familiarity, whereas AIC has high connectivity with high-context familiarity. To the best of our knowledge, the context familiarity and its influence on cardiac and brain activity have never been reported with a naturalistic paradigm. Hence, this study significantly contributes to understanding automatic processing of emotions by analyzing the effect of context un/familiarity on affective feelings, the dynamics of cardiac-brain mutual interaction, and the brain{\textquoteright}s effective connectivity during pre-awareness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a fastpaced time-to-contact (TTC) estimation task, we found that the hippocampus signaled behavioral feedback received in each trial as well as performance improvements across trials along with reward-processing regions. Critically, it signaled performance improvements independent from the tested intervals, and its activity accounted for the trial-wise regression-to-the-mean biases in TTC estimation. This suggests that the hippocampus supports the rapid encoding of temporal context even on short time scales in a behavior-dependent manner. Our results emphasize the central role of the hippocampus in statistical learning and position it at the core of a brain-wide network updating sensorimotor representations in real time for flexible behavior.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Stimuli that evoke the same feelings can nevertheless look different and have different semantic meanings. Although we know much about the neural representation of emotion, the neural underpinnings that govern judgements of emotional similarity are unknown. One possibility is that the same brain regions will represent similarity between emotional and neutral stimuli, perhaps with different strengths. Alternatively, emotional similarity could be coded in separate regions, possibly those known to express emotional valence and arousal preferentially. In behaviour, the extent to which people consider similarity along the emotional dimension when they evaluate the overall similarity between stimuli has never been investigated. While the emotional features of stimuli may dominate explicit ratings of similarity, it is also possible that people neglect the emotional dimension as irrelevant. We contrasted these hypotheses with two measures of similarity and two different databases of complex negative and neutral pictures, the second of which afforded exquisite control over semantic and visual attributes. Emotion increased neural similarity in a set of regions that represented both emotional and neutral stimuli, including the inferior temporal cortex, the fusiform face area, and the precuneus. Emotion also increased neural similarity in early visual cortex, anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, despite no increase in BOLD-signal amplitudes in these regions. Despite the stronger neural similarity between emotional stimuli, participants rated pictures taken from two distinct emotional categories as equally similar. These results contribute to our understanding of how emotion is represented within a general conceptual workspace.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We implement the RML in a biologically plausible architecture that links catecholaminergic neuromodulators, the medial prefrontal cortex and topographically organized visual maps and show that it accounts for neural and behavioral findings on information demand motivated by instrumental incentives and intrinsic utility. Moreover, the utility function used by the RML, encoded by dopamine, is an approximation of free-energy. Thus, the RML presents a biologically plausible mechanism through which coordinated motivational, executive and sensory systems generate visual information gathering policies that minimize free energy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Bayesian models successfully account for several of dopamine (DA){\textquoteright}s effects on contextual calibration in interval timing and reward estimation. In these models, tonic levels of DA control the precision of stimulus encoding, which is weighed against contextual information when making decisions. When DA levels are high, the animal relies more heavily on the (highly precise) stimulus encoding, whereas when DA levels are low, the context affects decisions more strongly. Here, we extend this idea to intertemporal choice and probability discounting tasks. In intertemporal choice tasks, agents must choose between a small reward delivered soon and a large reward delivered later, whereas in probability discounting tasks, agents must choose between a small reward that is always delivered and a large reward that may be omitted with some probability. Beginning with the principle that animals will seek to maximize their reward rates, we show that the Bayesian model predicts a number of curious empirical findings in both tasks. First, the model predicts that higher DA levels should normally promote selection of the larger/later option, which is often taken to imply that DA decreases {\textquoteleft}impulsivity,{\textquoteright} and promote selection of the large/risky option, often taken to imply that DA increases {\textquoteleft}risk-seeking.{\textquoteright} However, if the temporal precision is sufficiently decreased, higher DA levels should have the opposite effect{\textemdash}promoting selection of the smaller/sooner option (higher impulsivity) and the small/safe option (lower risk-seeking). Second, high enough levels of DA can result in preference reversals. Third, selectively decreasing the temporal precision, without manipulating DA, should promote selection of the larger/later and large/risky options. Fourth, when a different post-reward delay is associated with each option, animals will not learn the option-delay contingencies, but this learning can be salvaged when the post-reward delays are made more salient. Finally, the Bayesian model predicts correlations among behavioral phenotypes: Animals that are better timers will also appear less impulsive.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {While traditional theories of sensorimotor processing have often assumed a serial decision-making pipeline, more recent approaches have suggested that multiple actions may be planned concurrently and vie for execution. Evidence for the latter almost exclusively stems from electrophysiological studies in posterior parietal and premotor cortex of monkeys. Here we study concurrent prospective motor planning in humans by recording functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a delayed response task engaging movement sequences towards multiple potential targets. We find that also in human posterior parietal and premotor cortex delay activity modulates both with sequence complexity and the number of potential targets. We tested the hypothesis that this modulation is best explained by concurrent prospective planning as opposed to the mere maintenance of potential targets in memory. We devise a bounded rationality model with information constraints that optimally assigns information resources for planning and memory for this task and determine predicted information profiles according to the two hypotheses. When regressing delay activity on these model predictions, we find that the concurrent prospective planning strategy provides a significantly better explanation of the fMRI-signal modulations. Moreover, we find that concurrent prospective planning is more costly and thus limited for most subjects, as expressed by the best fitting information capacities. We conclude that bounded rational decision-making models allow relating both behavior and neural representations to utilitarian task descriptions based on bounded optimal information-processing assumptions.Author summary When the future is uncertain, it can be beneficial to concurrently plan several action possibilities in advance. Electrophysiological research found evidence in monkeys that brain regions in posterior parietal and promotor cortex are indeed capable of planning several actions in parallel. We now used fMRI to study brain activity in these brain regions in humans. For our analyses we applied bounded rationality models that optimally assign information resources to fMRI activity in a complex motor planning task. We find that theoretical information costs of concurrent prospective planning explained fMRI activity profiles significantly better than assuming alternative memory-based strategies. Moreover, exploiting the model allowed us to quantify the individual capacity limit for concurrent planning and to relate these individual limits to both subjects{\textquoteright} behavior and to their neural representations of planning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The response of an animal to a sensory stimulus depends on the nature of the stimulus and on predictions mediated by spontaneous activity in neurons. Here, we ask how circadian variation in the prediction of danger, and thus the response to a potential threat, is controlled. We focus on the habenula, a mediator of threat response that functions by regulating neuromodulator release, and use zebrafish as the experimental system. Single cell transcriptomics indicates that multiple clock genes are expressed throughout the habenula, while quantitative in situ hybridization confirms that the clock oscillates. Two-photon calcium imaging indicates a circadian change in spontaneous activity of habenula neurons. To assess the role of this clock, a truncated clocka gene was specifically expressed in the habenula. This partially inhibited the clock, as shown by changes in per3 expression as well as altered day-night variation in dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine levels. Behaviourally, anxiety-like responses evoked by an alarm pheromone were reduced. Circadian effects of the pheromone were disrupted, such that responses in the day resembled those at night. Behaviours that are regulated by the pineal clock and not triggered by stressors were unaffected. These findings establish that the habenula clock regulates the expectation of danger, thus identifying one mechanism for circadian change in the response to a stressor.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Human perception and experience of time is strongly influenced by ongoing stimulation, memory of past experiences, and required task context. When paying attention to time, time experience seems to expand; when distracted, it seems to contract. When considering time based on memory, the experience may be different than in the moment, exemplified by sayings like {\textquotedblleft}time flies when you{\textquoteright}re having fun{\textquotedblright}. Experience of time also depends on the content of perceptual experience {\textendash} rapidly changing or complex perceptual scenes seem longer in duration than less dynamic ones. The complexity of interactions between attention, memory, and perceptual stimulation is a likely reason that an overarching theory of time perception has been difficult to achieve. Here, we introduce a model of perceptual processing and episodic memory that makes use of hierarchical predictive coding, short-term plasticity, spatio-temporal attention, and episodic memory formation and recall, and apply this model to the problem of human time perception. In an experiment with ~ 13, 000 human participants we investigated the effects of memory, cognitive load, and stimulus content on duration reports of dynamic natural scenes up to ~ 1 minute long. Using our model to generate duration estimates, we compared human and model performance. Model-based estimates replicated key qualitative biases, including differences by cognitive load (attention), scene type (stimulation), and whether the judgement was made based on current or remembered experience (memory). Our work provides a comprehensive model of human time perception and a foundation for exploring the computational basis of episodic memory within a hierarchical predictive coding framework.Author summary Experience of the duration of present or past events is a central aspect of human experience, the underlying mechanisms of which are not yet fully understood. In this work, we combine insights from machine learning and neuroscience to propose a combination of mathematical models that replicate human perceptual processing, long-term memory, attention, and duration perception. Our computational implementation of this framework can process information from video clips of ordinary life scenes, record and recall important events, and report the duration of these clips. To assess the validity of our proposal, we conducted an experiment with ~ 13, 000 human participants. Each was shown a video between 1-64 seconds long and reported how long they believed it was. Reports of duration by our computational model qualitatively matched these human reports, made about the exact same videos. This was true regardless of the video content, whether time was actively judged or based on memory of the video, or whether the participants focused on a single task or were distracted - all factors known to influence human time perception. Our work provides the first model of human duration perception to incorporate these diverse and complex factors and provides a basis to probe the deep links between memory and time in human experience.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Kinase inhibitors are one of the largest classes of FDA-approved drugs and are major targets in oncology. Although kinase inhibitors have played an important role in improving cancer outcomes, major challenges still exist, including the development of resistance and failure to respond to treatments. Improvements for tumor profiling of kinase activity would be an important step in improving treatment outcomes and identifying effective kinase targets. Here, we present a graph- and statistics-based algorithm, called KSTAR, which harnesses the phosphoproteomic profiling of human cells and tissues by predicting kinase activity profiles from the observed phosphorylation of kinase substrates. The algorithm is based on the hypothesis that the more active a kinase is, the more of its substrates will be observed in a phosphoproteomic experiment. This method is error- and bias-aware in its approach, overcoming challenges presented by the variability of phosphoproteomic pipelines, limited information about kinase-substrate relationships, and limitations of global kinase-substrate predictions, such as training set bias and high overlap between predicted kinase networks. We demonstrate that the predicted kinase activities: 1) reproduce physiologically-relevant expectations and generates novel hypotheses within cell-specific experiments, 2) improve the ability to compare phosphoproteomic samples on the same tissues from different labs, and 3) identify tissue-specific kinase profiles. Global benchmarking and comparison to other algorithms demonstrates that KSTAR is particularly superior for predicting tyrosine kinase activities and, given its focus on utilizing more of the available phosphoproteomic data, significantly less sensitive to study bias. Finally, we apply the approach to complex human tissue biopsies in breast cancer, where we find that KSTAR activity predictions complement current clinical standards for identifying HER2-status {\textendash} KSTAR can identify clinical false positives, patients who will fail to respond to inhibitor therapy, and clinically defined HER2-negative patients that might benefit from HER2-targeted therapy. KSTAR will be useful for both basic biological understanding of signaling networks and for improving clinical outcomes through improved clinical trial design, identification of new and/or combination therapies, and for identifying the failure to respond to targeted kinase therapies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Individual variation of affective and cognitive traits, as well as brain structure, has been shown to partly underlie genetic effects.

Here we studied phenotypic and genetic correlations of cognitive and affective traits in behavior and brain structure (cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes) in the twin-based Human Connectome Project sample (N = 1091). Both affective and cognitive trait scores were highly heritable and showed significant phenotypic correlation on the behavioral level. Cortical thickness in the left superior frontal cortex showed a phenotypic association with both affect and cognition, which was driven by shared genetic effects. Quantitative functional decoding of this region yielded associations with cognitive and emotional functioning. This study provides a multi-level approach to study the association between affect and cognition and suggests a convergence of both in superior frontal cortical thickness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Despite this important role of touch, tactile sensations on a moving hand are perceived weaker than when presented on the same but stationary hand.1{\textendash}3 This phenomenon of tactile suppression has been explained by predictive mechanisms, such as forward models, that estimate future sensory states of the body on the basis of the motor command and suppress the associated predicted sensory feedback.4 The origins of tactile suppression have sparked a lot of debate, with contemporary accounts claiming that suppression is independent of predictive mechanisms and is instead akin to unspecific gating.5 Here, we target this debate and provide evidence for sensation-specific tactile suppression due to sensorimotor predictions. Participants stroked with their finger over textured surfaces that caused predictable vibrotactile feedback signals on that finger. Shortly before touching the texture, we applied external vibrotactile probes on the moving finger that either matched or mismatched the frequency generated by the stroking movement. We found stronger suppression of the probes that matched the predicted sensory feedback. These results show that tactile suppression is not limited to unspecific gating but is specifically tuned to the predicted sensory states of a movement.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging research on depression has traditionally targeted neural networks associated with the psychological aspects of depression. In this study, instead, we focus on alterations of sensorimotor function in depression. We used resting-state functional MRI data and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to assess the hypothesis that depression is associated with aberrant effective connectivity within and between key regions in the sensorimotor hierarchy. Using hierarchical modeling of between-subject effects in DCM with Parametric Empirical Bayes we first established the architecture of effective connectivity in sensorimotor cortices. We found that in (interoceptive and exteroceptive) sensory cortices across participants, the backward connections are predominantly inhibitory whereas the forward connections are mainly excitatory in nature. In motor cortices these parities were reversed. With increasing depression severity, these patterns are depreciated in exteroceptive and motor cortices and augmented in the interoceptive cortex: an observation that speaks to depressive symptomatology. We established the robustness of these results in a leave-one-out cross validation analysis and by reproducing the main results in a follow-up dataset. Interestingly, with (non-pharmacological) treatment, depression associated changes in backward and forward effective connectivity partially reverted to group mean levels. Overall, altered effective connectivity in sensorimotor cortices emerges as a promising and quantifiable candidate marker of depression severity and treatment response.Significance Statement Research into neurobiology of depression primarily focuses on its complex psychological aspects. Here, we propose an alternative approach and target sensorimotor alterations - a prominent but often neglected feature of depression. We demonstrated using resting-state fMRI data and computational modelling that top-down and bottom-up information flow in sensory and motor cortices is altered with increasing depression severity in a way that is consistent with depression symptoms. Depression associated changes were found to be consistent across sessions, amenable to treatment and of effect size sufficiently large to predict whether somebody has mild or severe depression. These results pave the way for a new avenue of research into the neural underpinnings of mental health conditions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, we investigated the brain mechanisms associated with the reliability of directional information used for motor preparation. We recorded brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a delayed reaching task in which a visual cue provided valid information about the location of the upcoming target with 50, 75 or 100\% reliability. We found that reaction time increased as cue reliability decreased and that trials with invalid cues had longer reaction times than trials with valid cues. MEG channel analysis showed that during the late cue period the power of the beta-band from left mid-anterior channels, contralateral to the responding hand, correlated with the reliability of the cue. This effect was source localized over a large motor-related cortical and subcortical network. In addition, during invalid-cue trials there was a phasic increase of theta-band power following target onset from left posterior channels, localized to the left occipito-parietal cortex. Furthermore, the theta-beta cross-frequency coupling between left mid-occipital and motor cortex transiently increased before responses to invalid-cue trials. In conclusion, beta-band power in motor-related areas reflected the reliability of directional information used during motor preparation, whereas phasic theta-band activity may have signaled whether the target was at the expected location or not. These results elucidate mechanisms of interaction between attentional and motor processes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Pulsatile GnRH release is essential for normal reproductive function. Kisspeptin secreting neurons found in the arcuate nucleus, known as KNDy neurons for co-expressing neurokinin B, and dynorphin, drive pulsatile GnRH release. Furthermore, gonadal steroids regulate GnRH pulsatile dynamics across the ovarian cycle by altering KNDy neurons{\textquoteright} signalling properties. However, the precise mechanism of regulation remains mostly unknown. To better understand these mechanisms we start by perturbing the KNDy system at different stages of the estrous cycle using optogenetics. We find that optogenetic stimulation of KNDy neurons stimulates pulsatile GnRH/LH secretion in estrous mice but inhibits it in diestrous mice. These in-vivo results in combination with mathematical modelling suggest that the transition between estrus and diestrus is underpinned by well-orchestrated changes in neuropeptide signalling and in the excitability of the KNDy population controlled via glutamate signalling. Guided by model predictions, we show that blocking glutamate signalling in diestrous animals inhibits LH pulses, and that optic stimulation of the KNDy population mitigates this inhibition. In estrous mice, disruption of glutamate signalling inhibits pulses generated via sustained low-frequency optic stimulation of the KNDy population, supporting the idea that the level of network excitability is critical for pulse generation. Our results reconcile previous puzzling findings regarding the estradiol-dependent effect that several neuromodulators have on the GnRH pulse generator dynamics. Therefore, we anticipate our model to be a cornerstone for a more quantitative understanding of the pathways via which gonadal steroids regulate GnRH pulse generator dynamics. Finally, our results could inform useful repurposing of drugs targeting the glutamate system in reproductive therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {While it is well established that dopamine transmission is integral in mediating the influence of reward expectations on reward-seeking actions, the precise causal role of dopamine transmission in moment-to-moment cue-driven behavioural control remains contentious. This is a particular issue in situations where it is necessary to refrain from responding to achieve a beneficial outcome. To examine this, we manipulated dopamine transmission pharmacologically as rats performed a Go/No-Go task that required them to either make or withhold action to gain either a small or large reward. Stimulation of D1Rs, both globally and locally in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) region consistently disrupted No-Go performance, potentiating inappropriate responses that clustered strongly just after cue presentation. D1R blockade did not, however, improve rats{\textquoteright} ability to withhold responses, but instead primarily disrupted performance on Go trials. While global D1R blockade caused a general reduction of invigoration of reward seeking actions, intra-NAcC administration of the D1R antagonist by contrast increased the likelihood that Go trial performance was in an {\textquotedblleft}unfocused{\textquotedblright} state. Such a state was characterised, both on and off drug, by a reduction in the precision and speed of responding even though the appropriate action sequence was often executed. These findings suggests that the balance of activity at NAcC D1Rs plays a key role in enabling the rapid activation of a focused, reward-seeking state to enable animals to efficiently and accurately achieve their goal.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

To address this issue, we have investigated the daily evolution of CA1 dynamics and underlying circuits during the first two postnatal weeks of mouse development using two-photon calcium imaging in non-anesthetized pups. We show that the first postnatal week ends with an abrupt shift in the representation of self-motion in CA1. Indeed, most CA1 pyramidal cells switch from activated to inhibited by self-generated movements at the end of the first postnatal week whereas the majority of GABAergic neurons remain positively modulated throughout this period. This rapid switch occurs within two days and follows the rapid anatomical and functional surge of local somatic GABAergic innervation. The observed change in dynamics is consistent with a two-population model undergoing a strengthening of inhibition. We propose that this abrupt developmental transition inaugurates the emergence of internal cognitive models.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Processing of negative affective pictures typically leads to desynchronization of alpha-to-beta frequencies (ERD) and synchronization of gamma frequencies (ERS). Given that in predictive coding higher frequencies have been associated with prediction errors, while lower frequencies have been linked to expectations, we tested the hypothesis that alpha-to-beta ERD and gamma ERS induced by aversive pictures are associated with expectations and prediction errors, respectively. We recorded EEG while volunteers were involved in a probabilistically cued affective picture task using three different negative valences to produce expectations and prediction errors. Our data show that alpha-to-beta band activity was related to the expected valence of the stimulus as predicted by a cue. The absolute mismatch of the expected and actual valence, which denotes an absolute prediction error was related to gamma band activity. This demonstrates that top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors are represented in specific spectral patterns associated with affective picture processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Classical views suggest that experienced affect is related to a specific bodily response (Fingerprint hypothesis), whereas recent perspectives challenge this view postulating that similar affective experiences rather evoke different physiological responses. To further advance this debate in the field, we used representational similarity analysis (N= 64) to investigate the correspondence between subjective affect (arousal and valence ratings) and physiological reactions (skin conductance response [SCR], startle blink response, heart rate and corrugator activity) across various emotion induction contexts (picture viewing task, sound listening task and imagery task). Significant similarities were exclusively observed between SCR and arousal in the picture viewing task. However, none of the other physiological measures showed a significant relation with valence and arousal ratings in any of the tasks. These findings tend to support the populations hypothesis, suggesting that there is no clear match between the evoked physiological responses and the experienced subjective affect between individuals.Statement of relevance The subjective affective experience evoked by an event is accompanied by physiological responses. The correspondence between physiological response patterns and the experienced affect, however, is still under debate. Classical views (Fingerprint hypothesis) suggest that affect is related to a specific physiological response, whereas recent perspectives (Populations hypothesis) challenge this view, postulating rather different physiological responses. In the current study, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to examine the relation between affective experience, assessed using valence and arousal ratings, and the evoked physiological reactivity across three affect-inducing contexts. Results showed significant similarities exclusively between SCR and arousal in the passive picture viewing task. However, none of the other physiological measures showed a significant relation with valence and arousal ratings in any of the tasks, supporting the populations hypothesis. These findings invite to reframe the relation between physiology and affect from invariant and homogeneous to variant and context-dependent.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We found that transient reprogramming restored youthful gene expression in adipogenic cells and mesenchymal stem cells but also temporarily suppressed somatic cell identity programs. We further screened Yamanaka Factor subsets and found that many combinations had an impact on aging gene expression and suppressed somatic identity, but that these effects were not tightly entangled. We also found that a transient reprogramming approach inspired by amphibian regeneration restored youthful gene expression in aged myogenic cells. Our results suggest that transient pluripotent reprogramming poses a neoplastic risk, but that restoration of youthful gene expression can be achieved with alternative strategies.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are paid employees of Calico Life Sciences LLC, South San Francisco, California, 94080.},

Two major developments address some of the challenges presented by low trial numbers in interoceptive experiments: (i) a novel adaptive algorithm to maintain task performance at 70-75\% accuracy; (ii) an extended hierarchical metacognitive model to estimate regression parameters linking metacognitive performance to relevant (e.g. clinical) variables. We demonstrate the utility of the task and analysis developments, using both simulated data and three empirical datasets.

	abstract = {Empathy for pain engages both shared affective responses and self-other distinction. In this study, we addressed the highly debated question of whether neural responses previously linked to affect sharing could result from the perception of salient affective displays. Moreover, we investigated how affect sharing and self-other distinction interact to determine our response to a pain that is either perceived as genuine or pretended (while in fact both were acted for reasons of experimental control). We found stronger activations in regions associated with affect sharing (anterior insula, aIns, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex, aMCC) as well as with affective self-other distinction (right supramarginal gyrus, rSMG), in participants watching video clips of genuine vs. pretended facial expressions of pain. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we then assessed the neural dynamics between the right aIns and rSMG in these two conditions. This revealed a reduced inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection for genuine compared to pretended pain. For genuine pain only, brain-to-behavior regression analyses highlighted a linkage between this inhibitory effect on the one hand, and pain ratings as well as empathic traits on the other. These findings imply that if the pain of others is genuine and thus calls for an appropriate empathic response, neural responses in the aIns indeed seem related to affect sharing and self-other distinction is engaged to avoid empathic over-arousal. In contrast, if others merely pretend to be in pain, the perceptual salience of their painful expression results in neural responses that are down-regulated to avoid inappropriate affect sharing and social support.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Anxiety influences how the brain estimates and responds to uncertainty. These behavioural effects have been described within predictive coding and Bayesian inference frameworks, yet the associated neural correlates remain unclear. Recent work suggests that predictions in generative models of perception are represented in alpha (8{\textendash}12 Hz) and beta oscillations (13{\textendash}30 Hz). Updates to predictions are driven by prediction errors weighted by precision (inverse variance; pwPE), and are encoded in gamma oscillations (\&gt;30 Hz) and associated with suppression of beta activity. We tested whether state anxiety alters the neural oscillatory activity associated with predictions and pwPE during learning. Healthy human participants performed a probabilistic reward-learning task in a volatile environment. In our previous work, we described learning behaviour in this task using a hierarchical Bayesian model, revealing more precise (biased) beliefs about the reward tendency in state anxiety, consistent with reduced learning in this group. The model provided trajectories of predictions and pwPEs for the current study, allowing us to assess their parametric effects on the time-frequency representations of EEG data. Using convolution modelling for oscillatory responses, we found that, relative to a control group, state anxiety increased beta activity in frontal and sensorimotor regions during processing of pwPE, and in fronto-parietal regions during encoding of predictions. No effects of state anxiety on gamma modulation were found. Our findings expand prior evidence on the oscillatory representations of predictions and pwPEs into the reward-learning domain. The results suggest that state anxiety modulates beta-band oscillatory correlates of pwPE and predictions in generative models, providing insights into the neural processes associated with biased belief updating and poorer reward learning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We applied Confirmatory FA to the HGSHS:A scores of 477 volunteers and tested several theory-driven models. Scores were best explained by a bifactor model consisting of a G-factor and three correlated minor factors. The presented bifactor model shows that two sources of variability affect HGSHS:A simultaneously. Structural equation modeling revealed that the challenge-ideomotor factor predicts the other two minor factors, implying these suggestions might require more fundamental processes than other types. These results demonstrate the multifaceted and bifactorial structure of hypnotic suggestibility and underscore the desideratum for developing more differentiated scales.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of visual scanning mechanism underpinning sensorimotor tasks in 3D dynamic environments. We exploit the use of eye tracking data as a behaviometric, for indicating the visuo-motor behavioral measures in the context of virtual driving. A new metric of visual scanning efficiency (VSE), which is defined as a mathematical divergence between a fixation distribution and a distribution of optical flows induced by fixations, is proposed by making use of a widely-known information theoretic tool, namely the square root of Jensen-Shannon divergence. Based on the proposed efficiency metric, a cognitive effort measure (CEM) is developed by using the concept of quantity of information. Psychophysical eye tracking studies, in virtual reality based driving, are conducted to reveal that the new metric of visual scanning efficiency can be employed very well as a proxy evaluation for driving performance. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive effort measure is demonstrated by a strong correlation between this measure and pupil size change. These results suggest that the exploitation of eye tracking data provides an effective behaviometric for sensorimotor activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here, to address this issue, we used finger tracking to continuously monitor the online build-up of evidence, confidence, false alarms and changes-of-mind during sequence processing. All these aspects of behaviour conformed tightly to a hierarchical Bayesian inference model with distinct hypothesis spaces for statistics and rules, yet linked by a single probabilistic currency. Alternative models based either on a single statistical mechanism or on two non-commensurable systems were rejected.

	abstract = {Homeostatic control with oral nutrient intake is a vital complex system involving the orderly interactions between the external and internal senses, behavioral control, and reward learning. Sodium appetite is a representative system and has been intensively investigated in animal models of homeostatic systems and oral nutrient intake. However, the system-level mechanisms for regulating sodium intake behavior and homeostatic control remain unclear.In the current study, we attempted to provide a mechanistic understanding of sodium appetite behavior by using a computational model, the homeostatic reinforcement learning model, in which homeostatic behaviors are interpreted as reinforcement learning processes. Through simulation experiments, we confirmed that our homeostatic reinforcement learning model successfully reproduced homeostatic behaviors by regulating sodium appetite. These behaviors include the approach and avoidance behaviors to sodium according to the internal states of individuals. In addition, based on the assumption that the sense of taste is a predictor of changes in the internal state, the homeostatic reinforcement learning model successfully reproduced the previous paradoxical observations of the intragastric infusion test, which cannot be explained by the classical drive reduction theory. Moreover, we extended the homeostatic reinforcement learning model to multi-modal data, and successfully reproduced the behavioral tests in which water and sodium appetite were mediated by each other. Finally, through an experimental simulation of chemical manipulation in a specific neural population in the brain stem, we proposed a testable hypothesis for the function of neural circuits involving sodium appetite behavior.The study results support the idea that osmoregulation via sodium appetitive behavior can be understood as a reinforcement learning process and provide a mechanistic explanation for the underlying neural mechanisms of sodium appetite and homeostatic behavior.Author Summary The taste of high-concentration saltwater is rewarding during sodium depletion, while it is aversive in a sodium sufficient state. This {\textquotedblleft}sodium appetite{\textquotedblright} is a clear manifestation of homeostasis maintenance and proper action selection in animals, reflecting the internal environment. To reveal the computational mechanism of this property, we applied a machine learning model, in which homeostatic stability is a reward and the goal is to maximize the sum of the reward, and simulated animal behavioral experiments. The results suggest that the mechanism of sodium-appetite behavior is based on the machine learning model. Specifically, by replicating the results of neural circuit manipulation, which controls sodium appetite, an algorithm in which the function of a neural population affects sodium appetite behaviors was proposed. Our results provide a fundamental computational model for a mechanism by a function of a neural cell type to regulate animal behavior. More generally, this study can be fundamental to understanding the computational process of decision making reflecting the internal environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms coordinating action and perception over time are poorly understood. The sensory cortex needs to prepare for upcoming changes contingent on action, and this requires temporally precise communication that takes into account the variable delays between sensory and motor processing. Several theorists1,2 have proposed synchronization of the endogenous oscillatory activity observed in most regions of the brain3 as the basis for an efficient and flexible communication protocol between distal brain areas2,4, a concept known as {\textquotedblleft}communication through coherence{\textquotedblright}. Synchronization of endogenous oscillations5,6 occurs after a salient sensory stimulus, such as a flash or a sound7{\textendash}11, and after a voluntary action12{\textendash}18, and this impacts directly on perception, causing performance to oscillate rhythmically over time. Here we introduce a novel fMRI paradigm to probe the neural sources of oscillations, based on the concept of perturbative signals, which overcomes the low temporal resolution of BOLD signals. The assumption is that a synchronized endogenous rhythm will modulate cortical excitability rhythmically, which should be reflected in the BOLD responses to brief stimuli presented at different phases of the oscillation cycle. We record rhythmic oscillations of V1 BOLD synchronized by a simple voluntary action, in phase with behaviourally measured oscillations in visual sensitivity in the theta range. The functional connectivity between V1 and M1 also oscillates at the same rhythm. By demonstrating oscillatory temporal coupling between primary motor and sensory cortices, our results strongly implicate communication through coherence to achieve precise coordination and to encode sensory-motor timing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Dopamine signaling is thought to mediate reward-based learning. We tested for a role of dopamine in motor adaptation by administering the dopamine precursor levodopa to healthy participants in two experiments involving reaching movements. Levodopa has been shown to impair reward-based learning in cognitive tasks. Thus, we hypothesized that levodopa would selectively impair aspects of motor adaptation that depend on reinforcement of rewarding actions.In the first experiment, participants performed two separate tasks in which adaptation was driven either by visual error-based feedback of the hand position or binary reward feedback. We used EEG to measure event-related potentials evoked by task feedback. We hypothesized that levodopa would specifically diminish adaptation and the neural responses to feedback in the reward learning task. However, levodopa did not affect motor adaptation in either task nor did it diminish event-related potentials elicited by reward outcomes.In the second experiment, participants learned to compensate for mechanical force field perturbations applied to the hand during reaching. Previous exposure to a particular force field can result in savings during subsequent adaptation to the same force field or interference during adaptation to an opposite force field. We hypothesized that levodopa would diminish savings and anterograde interference, as previous work suggests that these phenomena result from a reinforcement learning process. However, we found no reliable effects of levodopa.These results suggest that reward-based motor adaptation, savings, and interference may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms that have been shown to be disrupted by levodopa during various cognitive tasks.New and Noteworthy Motor adaptation relies on multiple processes including reinforcement of successful actions. Cognitive reinforcement learning is impaired by levodopa-induced disruption of dopamine function. We administered levodopa to healthy adults who participated in multiple motor adaptation tasks. We found no effects of levodopa on any component of motor adaptation. This suggests that motor adaptation may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms as cognitive forms or reinforcement learning that have been shown to be impaired by levodopa.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Whilst everyday interactions with objects often involve multiple tactile contacts, integration of tactile signals remains poorly understood. Here we characterise the integration process of tactile motion on multiple fingerpads. Across four experiments, participants averaged the direction of two simultaneous tactile motion trajectories delivered to different fingerpads. Averaging performance differed between within- and between-hands in terms of sensitivity and precision but was unaffected by somatotopic proximity between stimulated fingers. The sensitivity to the average direction was influenced by the discrepancy between individual motion signals, but only for within-hand conditions. This was explained by a model, in which the {\textquoteleft}virtually leading finger{\textquoteright} received a higher perceptual weighting. Precision was greater in between-hand compared to within-hand conditions. While biased weighting accounted for differences in sensitivity, it was not sufficient to explain the difference in precision, implying additional sensory limitations during within-hand integration. We suggest that unimanual integration is limited and thus exploits a {\textquoteleft}natural{\textquoteright} cognitive prior involving a single object moving relative to the hand to maximise information gain.Author summary Tactile stimulation is always on. Yet little is known about how the brain combines widespread tactile inputs for perception. Most tactile studies emphasize a single point of tactile stimulation (e.g., location or intensity of a static stimulus) and minimal units of tactile perception (e.g., acuity or selectivity). However, our daily interactions with the world involve encoding spatially and temporally extended tactile signals. Perceiving tactile objects and events as coherent entities requires the somatosensory system to aggregate tactile afferent signals across separate skin regions (i.e., separate digits). Across four experiments we asked participants to average direction of two tactile motion trajectories delivered simultaneously to two different fingerpads, either on the same, or on different hands. Our results show strong integration between multiple tactile inputs, but subject to limitations for inputs delivered within a hand. Our model suggests that tactile inputs are weighted according to an integrative model of hand-object interaction that operates within-hands on purely geometric information to prioritise {\textquoteleft}novel{\textquoteright} information from a {\textquoteleft}virtually leading finger{\textquoteright} (VLF).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We tested a key hypothesis of these accounts, that predictions are weighted in inference according to their precision (inverse variance). If correct, more precise self-related predictions should bias perception of another{\textquoteright}s emotional expression to a greater extent than less precise predictions. We manipulated predictions about upcoming own-pain (low or high magnitude) using cues that afforded either precise (a narrow range of possible magnitudes) or imprecise (a wide range) predictions. Participants judged pained facial expressions presented concurrently with own-pain to be more intense when own-pain was greater, and precise cues increased this biasing effect. Implications of conceptualising interpersonal influence in terms of predictive processing are discussed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Top-down attention is hypothesized to dynamically allocate limited neural resources to task-relevant computations. According to this view, sensory neurons are driven not only by stimuli but also by feedback signals from higher brain areas that adapt the sensory code to the goals of the organism and its belief about the state of the environment. Here we formalize this view by optimizing a model of population coding in the visual cortex for maximally accurate perceptual inference at minimal activity cost. The resulting optimality predictions reproduce measured properties of attentional modulation in the visual system and generate novel hypotheses about the functional role of top-down feedback, response variability, and noise correlations. Our results suggest that a range of seemingly disparate attentional phenomena can be derived from a general theory combining probabilistic inference with efficient coding in a dynamic environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Homeostatic synaptic scaling allows for bi-directional adjustment of the strength of synaptic connections in response to changes in their input. Protein phosphorylation modulates many neuronal and synaptic processes, but it has not been studied on a global, proteome-wide scale during synaptic scaling. To examine this, we used LC-MS/MS analyses to measure changes in the phosphoproteome in response to up- or down-scaling in cultured cortical neurons over minutes to 24 hours. Out of 45,000 phosphorylation events measured, ~3,300 (associated with 1,280 phospho-proteins) were regulated by homeostatic scaling. The activity-sensitive phosphoproteins were predominantly located at synapses and involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. We identified many early transient phosphorylation events which could serve as sensors for the activity offset as well as late and/or persistent phosphoregulation that could represent effector mechanisms driving the homeostatic response. Much of the persistent phosphorylation was reciprocally regulated by up- or down-scaling, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying these two poles of synaptic regulation make use of a common signaling axis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {When presented with complex rhythmic auditory stimuli, humans are able to track underlying temporal structure (e.g., a {\textquotedblleft}beat{\textquotedblright}), both covertly and with their movements. This capacity goes far beyond that of a simple entrained oscillator, drawing on contextual and enculturated timing expectations and adjusting rapidly to perturbations in event timing, phase, and tempo. Previous modeling work has described how entrainment to rhythms may be shaped by event timing expectations, but sheds little light on any underlying computational principles that could unify the phenomenon of expectation-based entrainment with other brain processes. Inspired by the predictive processing framework, we propose that the problem of rhythm tracking is naturally characterized as a problem of continuously estimating an underlying phase and tempo based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations. We present two inference problems formalizing this insight: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing) and PATIPPET (Phase and Tempo Inference). Variational solutions to these inference problems resemble previous {\textquotedblleft}Dynamic Attending{\textquotedblright} models of perceptual entrainment, but introduce new terms representing the dynamics of uncertainty and the influence of expectations in the absence of sensory events. These terms allow us to model multiple characteristics of covert and motor human rhythm tracking not addressed by other models, including sensitivity of error corrections to inter-event interval and perceived tempo changes induced by event omissions. We show that positing these novel influences in human entrainment yields a range of testable behavioral predictions. Guided by recent neurophysiological observations, we attempt to align the phase inference framework with a specific brain implementation. We also explore the potential of this normative framework to guide the interpretation of experimental data and serve as building blocks for even richer predictive processing and active inference models of timing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {While dexterity relies on the constant transmission of sensory information, unchecked feedback can be disruptive to behavior. Yet how somatosensory feedback from the hands is regulated as it first enters the brain, and whether this modulation exerts any influence on movement, remain unclear. Leveraging molecular-genetic access in mice, we find that tactile afferents from the hand recruit neurons in the brainstem cuneate nucleus whose activity is modulated by distinct classes of local inhibitory neurons. Selective manipulation of these inhibitory circuits can suppress or enhance the transmission of tactile information, affecting behaviors that rely on movement of the hands. Investigating whether these local circuits are subject to top-down control, we identify distinct descending cortical pathways that innervate cuneate in a complementary pattern. Somatosensory cortical neurons target the core tactile region of cuneate, while a large rostral cortical population drives feed-forward inhibition of tactile transmission through an inhibitory shell. These findings identify a circuit basis for tactile feedback modulation, enabling the effective execution of dexterous movement.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The capacity to form and update mental representations of the type and timing of sensory events is a central tenet of adaptive behavior in a dynamically changing environment. An internal model of stimulus contingencies provides a means to optimize behavior through predictive adjustments based on past to future events. To this end, neural and cognitive processes rely on systematic relations between events and use these rules to optimize information processing. The P3 complex of the event-related potential of the electroencephalogram (ERP/EEG) is a well-established and extensively tested index of such mechanisms. Here we investigated the P3b sensitivity to auditory stimulus deviations associated with two updating operations: physical change (switching stimulus pitches) and rule change (switching additive and subtractive target stimulus counting). Participants listened to a variant of the classical oddball sequence consisting of frequent standard (600 Hz) and two equally probable less frequent deviant tones (660 Hz, 540 Hz), keeping count of the deviant tones and switching between addition and subtraction with a pitch change. The results indicate specific amplitude modulations, confirming the P3b as a context-sensitive marker of physical and cognitive components of an internal model. This suggests that the P3b can be used as a differential marker of predictive coding mechanisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We start from the premise that the goal of interoceptive control is to minimize a discrepancy between expected and actual interoceptive sensations (i.e., a prediction error or free energy). Importantly, living organisms can achieve this goal by using various forms of interoceptive control: homeostatic, allostatic and goal-directed. We provide a computationally-guided analysis of these different forms of interoceptive control, by showing that they correspond to distinct generative models within Active Inference. Furthermore, we illustrate how these generative models may support empirical research, by predicting physiological and brain signals that may accompany both adaptive and maladaptive interoceptive control.HighlightsWe use Active Inference to provide formal models of interoceptive controlWe model homeostatic, allostatic and goal-directed forms of interoceptive controlOur simulations illustrate both adaptive interoceptive control and its dysfunctionsWe discuss how the models can aid empirical research on interoceptionCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Modulation of motor cortical activity in the beta frequency range is one of the strongest and most studied movement-related neural signals. At the single trial level, beta band activity is often characterized by transient bursting events rather than slowly modulating oscillations, suggesting a more rapid, information-encoding functional role than previously believed. Insight into how beta bursts are generated in sensorimotor circuits can provide important constraints to theories about their functional role for movement control. To this end, we leverage and extend recent developments in high precision MEG for temporally resolved laminar analysis of burst activity, combined with a neocortical circuit model that simulates the biophysical generators of the electrical currents which drive beta bursts. This approach pinpoints the generation of beta bursts in human motor cortex to distinct excitatory synaptic inputs to deep and superficial cortical layers, which drive current flow in opposite directions. These laminar dynamics of beta bursts in motor cortex align with prior invasive animal recordings within the somatosensory cortex, and suggest a conserved mechanism for somatosensory and motor cortical beta bursts. More generally, we demonstrate the ability for uncovering the laminar dynamics of event-related neural signals in human non-invasive recordings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Sensory consequences of one{\textquoteright}s own action are often perceived as less intense, and lead to reduced neural responses, compared to externally generated stimuli. Presumably, such sensory attenuation is due to predictive mechanisms based on the motor command (efference copy). However, sensory attenuation has also been observed outside the context of voluntary action, namely when stimuli are temporally predictable. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of motor and temporal predictability-based mechanisms on the attenuation of sensory action consequences. During fMRI data acquisition, participants (N = 25) judged which of two visual stimuli was brighter. In predictable blocks, the stimuli appeared temporally aligned with their button press (active) or aligned with an automatically generated cue (passive). In unpredictable blocks, stimuli were presented with a variable delay after button press/cue, respectively. Eye tracking was performed to investigate pupil-size changes and to ensure proper fixation. Self-generated stimuli were perceived as darker and led to less neural activation in visual areas than their passive counterparts, indicating sensory attenuation for self-generated stimuli independent of temporal predictability. Pupil size was larger during self-generated stimuli, which correlated negatively with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response: the larger the pupil, the smaller the BOLD amplitude in visual areas. Our results suggest that sensory attenuation in visual cortex is driven by action-based predictive mechanisms rather than by temporal predictability. This effect may be related to changes in pupil diameter. Altogether, these results emphasize the role of the efference copy in the processing of sensory action consequences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Following spinal cord injury (SCI), the motor output flow to the limb(s) and sensory input to the brain is largely lost. While attempted movements with the paralysed and sensory deprived body part can still evoke signals in the sensorimotor system, this task-related {\textquotedblleft}net{\textquotedblright} brain activity of SCI patients differs substantially from healthy controls. Such reorganised and/or altered activity is thought to reflect abnormal processing. It is however possible that this altered {\textquoteleft}net{\textquoteright} sensorimotor activity in SCI patients conceals preserved somatotopically-specific representations of the paralysed and sensory deprived body parts that could be exploited in a functionally meaningful manner (e.g. via neuroprosthetics).In this cross-sectional study, we investigated whether a functional connection between the periphery and the brain is necessary to maintain somatosensory representations. We used functional MRI and an (attempted) finger movement task to characterise the somatotopic hand layout in the primary somatosensory cortex and structural MRI to assess spared spinal tissue bridges. We tested 14 tetraplegic SCI patients (mean age {\textpm} s.e.m.=55 {\textpm} 3.6; 1 female) who differed in terms of lesion completeness, retained sensorimotor functioning, and time since injury, as well as 18 healthy control participants (mean age {\textpm} s.e.m.=56 {\textpm} 3.6 years; 1 female).Our results revealed somatotopically organised representations of patients{\textquoteright} hands in which neighbouring clusters showed selectivity for neighbouring fingers in contralateral S1, qualitatively similar to those observed in healthy controls. To quantify whether these representations were normal in tetraplegic SCI patients we correlated each participant{\textquoteright}s intricate representational distance pattern across all fingers (revealed using representational similarity analysis) with a canonical inter-finger distance pattern obtained from an independent sample. The resulting hand representation typicality scores were not significantly different between patients and controls. This was even true when considering two individual patients with no sensory hand functioning, no hand motor functioning, and no spared spinal tissue bridges. However, a correlational analysis revealed that over years since SCI the hand representation typicality in primary somatosensory cortex deteriorates.We show that somatosensory representations can be maintained for several years following SCI even in the absence of perhiperhal inputs. Such preserved cortical hand representations could therefore be exploited in a functionally meaningful way by rehabilitation approaches that attempt to establish new functional connections between the hand and the brain after an SCI (e.g. through neuroprosthetics). However, time since injury may critically influence the somatotopic representations of SCI patients and might thereby impact the success of such rehabilitation approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AISAmerican Spinal Injury Association impairment scaleBETbrain extraction toolBFBayes factorFEATFMRI Expert Analysis ToolFLIRTFMRIB{\textquoteright}s Linear Image Registration ToolfMRIfunctional MRIFSLFMRIB Software LibraryFWHMFull Width between Half MaximumGLMGeneral Linear ModelGRASSPGraded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and PrehensionHRFHaemodynamic Response FunctionISNCSCIInternational Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord InjuryM1primary motor cortexMCFLIRTMotion Correction using FMRIB{\textquoteright}s Linear Image Registration ToolS1primary somatosensory cortexSCIspinal cord injuryTEecho timeTMSTranscranial magnetic stimulationTRrepetition time},

Inter-stimulus-intervals were temporally regular (600 ms) or irregular (200-1000 ms).

Further, time-frequency data provided an index of temporal processing variability at the stimulation frequencies. We expected that cerebellar lesions lead to aberrant encoding and use of auditory information, reflected in the ERP morphology of peak amplitudes, latencies and typical suppression effects linked to stimulus predictability. Results confirm longer P50 peak latencies in patients and variable processing at stimulation frequencies covarying with the location of cerebellar damage.

Friston elaborated how there were ways of making an optimal decision using active inference that can offer perspectives to advances in artificial intelligence. These methods of optimization within the context of active inference can also be used as a framework for improving brain-computer interfaces (BCI). This way, BCIs can give rise to artificial curiosity in the way Friston had described during his session. Using Friston{\textquoteright}s free energy principle, we can optimize the criterion a BCI uses to infer the intentions of the user from EEG observations.

	abstract = {How do we mentally organize our memories of life events? Two episodes may be connected because they share a similar location, time period, activity, spatial environment, or social and emotional content. However, we lack an understanding of how each of these dimensions contributes to the perceived similarity of two life memories. We addressed this question with a data-driven approach, eliciting pairs of real-life memories from participants. Participants annotated the social, purposive, spatial, temporal, and emotional characteristics of their memories. We found that the overall similarity of memories was influenced by all of these factors, but to very different extents. Emotional features were the most consistent single predictor of overall memory similarity. Memories with different emotional tone were reliably perceived to be dissimilar, even when they occurred at similar times and places and involved similar people; conversely, memories with a shared emotional tone were perceived as similar even when they occurred at different times and places, and involved different people. A predictive model explained over half of the variance in memory similarity, using only information about (i) the emotional properties of events and (ii) the primary action or purpose of events. Emotional features may make an outsized contribution to event similarity because they provide compact summaries of an event{\textquoteright}s goals and self-related outcomes, which are critical information for future planning and decision making. Thus, in order to understand and improve real-world memory function, we must account for the strong influence of emotional and purposive information on memory organization and memory search.Significance Our brains enable us to understand and act within the present, informed by previous, related life experience. But how are our life experiences organized so that one event can be related to another? Theories have suggested that we use spatiotemporal, social, causal, purposive, and emotional dimensions to inter-relate our memories; however, these organizing principles are usually studied using impersonal laboratory stimuli. Here, we mapped and modeled the connections between people{\textquoteright}s own annotated life memories. We found that life events are linked by a variety of factors, but are predominantly connected in memory by their primary activity and emotional character. This highlights a need for theories of memory organization and retrieval to better account for the role of high-level actions and emotions.Competing Interest StatementMDB and CH have equity in Dynamic Memory Solutions, a company that develops tools for boosting real-world memory and mitigating memory decline.},

	abstract = {Functional recovery after brain damage varies widely and depends on many factors, including lesion site and extent. When a neuronal system is damaged, recovery may occur by engaging residual (e.g., perilesional) components. When damage is extensive, recovery depends on the availability of other intact neural structures that can reproduce the same functional output (i.e., degeneracy). A system{\textquoteright}s response to damage may occur rapidly, require learning or both. Here, we simulate functional recovery from four different types of lesions, using a generative model of word repetition that comprised a default premorbid system and a less used alternative system. The synthetic lesions (i) completely disengaged the premorbid system, leaving the alternative system intact, (ii) partially damaged both premorbid and alternative systems, and (iii) limited the experience-dependent plasticity of both. The results, across 1000 trials, demonstrate that (i) a complete disconnection of the premorbid system naturally invoked the engagement of the other, (ii) incomplete damage to both systems had a much more devastating long-term effect on model performance and (iii) the effect of reducing learning capacity within each system. These findings contribute to formal frameworks for interpreting the effect of different types of lesions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Interoception is the signalling, perception, and interpretation of internal physiological states. Much of the psychopharmacology of interoception is still undiscovered. However, psychiatric disorders associated with changes of interoception, including depressive, anxiety, and eating disorders are often treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The causal effect of acute changes of serotonin transmission on interoceptive cognition was tested by a within-participant, crossover, placebo-controlled study. Forty-seven healthy human volunteers (31 female, 16 male) were tested both on and off a 20mg oral dose of the commonly prescribed SSRI citalopram. For each randomly ordered session, participants made judgments on the synchrony of their heartbeat to auditory tones and expressed confidence in each of these judgments. Citalopram enhanced insight into the likelihood that one{\textquoteright}s interoceptive judgment had been correct, driven primarily by enhanced confidence for correct responses. This effect was independent of measured cardiac and subjective effects of the drug. This novel result is evidence that acute serotonin changes can alter metacognitive insight into the reliability of inferences based on interoceptive information, which is a foundation for considering effects of serotonin on cognition and emotion in terms of effective top-down regulation of interoceptive influence on mental states.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

To better understand AD, we generated 636 ATAC-seq libraries from cases and controls to construct detailed genomewide chromatin accessibility maps of neurons and non-neurons from two AD-affected brain regions, the entorhinal cortex and superior temporal gyrus. By analyzing a total of 19.6 billion read pairs, we expanded the known repertoire of regulatory sequences in the human brain. Multi-omic data integration associated global patterns of chromatin accessibility with gene expression and identified cell-specific enhancer-promoter interactions. Using inter-individual variation in chromatin accessibility, we define cis-regulatory domains capturing the 3D structure of the genome. Multifaceted analyses uncovered disease associated perturbations impacting chromatin accessibility, transcription factor regulatory networks and the 3D genome, and implicated transcriptional dysregulation in AD. Overall, we applied a systematic approach to understand the role of the 3D genome in AD and to illuminate novel disease biology that can advance diagnosis and therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The incorporation of this knowledge in RoKAI consistently enhances the accuracy of kinase activity inference methods while making them more robust to missing annotations and quantifications.

Theoretical frameworks of brain function, however, suggest the existence of a second, independent value system for optimizing information during decision-making. To date, however, there has been little direct empirical evidence in favor of such frameworks. Here, by using computational modeling, model-based fMRI analysis, and a novel experimental paradigm, we aim at establishing whether independent value systems exist in human PFC. We identify two regions in the human PFC which independently encode distinct value signals. These value signals are then combined in subcortical regions in order to implement choices. Our results provide empirical evidence for PFC as an optimizer of independent value signals during decision-making under realistic scenarios, with potential implications for the interpretation of PFC activity in both healthy and clinical population.One Sentence Summary Reward and information value are independently optimized in the Human PFC and are then combined in subcortical regions in order to implement choices.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Pupil response was used in the present study to explore the way expected and unexpected stimuli are encoded and whether encoding-linked pupil response is modulated by expectation. Participants first established a contingency relationship between a series of symbols and the type of stimulus (man-made or natural) that followed each one. At encoding, some of the target stimuli violated the previously established relationship (i.e., unexpected), while the majority conformed to this relationship (i.e., expected). Expectation at encoding had opposite effects on familiarity and recollection, the two types of memory that support recognition, and modulated differently the way pupil responses predicted subsequent memory. Encoding of unexpected novel stimuli was associated with increased pupil dilation as a predictor of subsequent memory type and strength. In contrast, encoding of expected novel stimuli was associated with decreased pupil response (constriction), which was predictive of subsequent memory type and strength. The findings support the close link between pupil response and memory formation, but critically indicate that this is modulated by the type of novelty as defined by expectation. These novel findings have important implications for the encoding mechanisms involved when different types of novelty are detected and is proposed to indicate the operation of different neurotransmitters in memory formation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Recognising speech in background noise is a strenuous daily activity, yet most humans can master it. An explanation of how the human brain deals with such sensory uncertainty during speech recognition is to-date missing. Previous work has shown that recognition of speech without background noise involves modulation of the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB): There are higher responses in left MGB for speech recognition tasks that require tracking of fast-varying stimulus properties in contrast to relatively constant stimulus properties (e.g., speaker identity tasks) despite the same stimulus input. Here we tested the hypotheses that (i) this task-dependent modulation for speech recognition increases in parallel with the sensory uncertainty in the speech signal, i.e., the amount of background noise and that (ii) this increase is present in the ventral MGB, which corresponds to the primary sensory part of the auditory thalamus. In accordance with our hypothesis, we show{\textemdash}by using ultra-high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants{\textemdash}that the task-dependent modulation of the left vMGB for speech is particularly strong when recognizing speech in noisy listening conditions in contrast to situations where the speech signal is clear. Exploratory analyses showed that this finding was specific to the left vMGB; it was not present in the right vMGB or the midbrain structure of the auditory pathway (left inferior colliculus, IC). The results imply that speech in noise recognition is supported by modifications at the level of the subcortical sensory pathway providing driving input to the auditory cortex.Significance Statement Speech recognition in noisy environments is a challenging everyday task. One reason why humans can master this task is the recruitment of additional cognitive resources as reflected in recruitment of non-language cerebral cortex areas. Here, we show that also modulation in the primary sensory pathway is specifically involved in speech in noise recognition. We found that the left primary sensory thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body, vMGB) is more involved when recognizing speech signals as opposed to a control task (speaker identity recognition) when heard in background noise vs. when the noise was absent. This finding implies that the brain optimises sensory processing in subcortical sensory pathway structures in a task-specific manner to deal with speech recognition in noisy environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

This work aims at improving accuracy and usability of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) where a user interacts with a physical robotic device (e.g., a human operated manipulator or exoskeleton) by transmitting signals which need to be interpreted by the machine. Typically these signals are used as an open-loop control, but this approach has several limitations such as low take-up and high cognitive burden for the user. In contrast, a control framework is proposed that can respond robustly and efficiently to intentions of a user by reacting proactively to their commands. The key insight is to include context- and user-awareness in the controller, improving decision making on how to assist the user. Context-awareness is achieved by creating a set of candidate grasp targets and reach-to grasp trajectories in a cluttered scene. User-awareness is implemented as a linear time-variant feedback controller (TV-LQR) over the generated trajectories to facilitate the motion towards the most likely intention of a user. The system also dynamically recovers from incorrect predictions. Experimental results in a virtual environment of two degrees of freedom control show the capability of this approach to outperform manual control. By robustly predicting the user{\textquoteright}s intention, the proposed controller allows the subject to achieve superhuman performance in terms of accuracy and thereby usability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In the domain of memory, the emotional valence and arousal of memorised stimuli can modulate both the acuity and content of episodic recall. However, no experiment has investigated whether arousal and valence also influence metacognition for memory (i.e., the process of self-monitoring memories). In a pre-registered study, we applied a novel psychophysiological design together with computational models of metacognition to assess the influence of stimulus valence and arousal on the sensitivity, bias, and efficiency of metamemory. To estimate the role of physiological arousal in mediating these effects, we recorded cardiac measures through pulse oximetry. We found that negative valence substantially decreased both memory performance and subjective confidence, in particular for low arousal words. Simultaneously, we found that emotional valence modulated both heart rate and heart-rate variability (HRV) during recognition memory. Exploratory trial-level analyses further revealed that subjective confidence was encoded in instantaneous heart-rate fluctuations and that this relationship was also modulated by emotional valence. Our results demonstrate that recognition memory and metacognition are influenced by the emotional valence of encoded items and that this correlation is in part related to cardiac activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Although many studies point to a sensory attenuation of self-generated stimuli, recent evidence suggests that motor actions can result in either attenuated or enhanced perceptual processing depending on the environmental context (i.e., stimulus intensity). The present study employed 2-AFC sound detection and loudness discrimination tasks to test whether sound source (self- or externally-generated) and stimulus intensity (supra- or near-threshold) interactively modulate detection ability and loudness perception. Self-generation did not affect detection and discrimination sensitivity (i.e., detection thresholds and Just Noticeable Difference, respectively). However, in the discrimination task, we observed a significant interaction between self-generation and intensity on perceptual bias (i.e. Point of Subjective Equality). Supra-threshold self-generated sounds were perceived softer than externally-generated ones, while at near-threshold intensities self-generated sounds were perceived louder than externally-generated ones. Our findings provide empirical support to recent theories on how predictions and signal intensity modulate perceptual processing, pointing to interactive effects of intensity and self-generation that seem to be driven by a biased estimate of perceived loudness, rather by changes in detection and discrimination sensitivity.HighlightsSelf-generation and stimulus intensity interactively shape auditory perception.Supra-threshold self-generated sounds are perceptually attenuated.When near-threshold, perceived intensity is enhanced for self-generated sounds.Self-generation and intensity modulate perceptual bias, rather than sensitivity.Surprise-driven attentional mechanisms may underlie these perceptual shifts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a key biomarker of automatic deviance detection thought to emerge from two cortical sources. First, the auditory cortex (AC) encodes spectral regularities and reports frequency-specific deviances. Then, more abstract representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) allow to detect contextual changes of potential behavioral relevance. However, the precise location and time asynchronies between neuronal correlates underlying this fronto-temporal network remain unclear and elusive. Our study presented auditory oddball paradigms along with {\textquoteleft}no-repetition{\textquoteright} controls to record mismatch responses in neuronal spiking activity and local field potentials at the rat medial PFC. Whereas mismatch responses in the auditory system are mainly induced by stimulus-dependent effects, we found that auditory responsiveness in the PFC was driven by unpredictability, yielding context-dependent, comparatively delayed, more robust and longer-lasting mismatch responses mostly comprised of prediction error signaling activity. This characteristically different composition discarded that mismatch responses in the PFC could be simply inherited or amplified downstream from the auditory system. Conversely, it is more plausible for the PFC to exert top-down influences on the AC, since the PFC exhibited flexible and potent predictive processing, capable of suppressing redundant input more efficiently than the AC. Remarkably, the time course of the mismatch responses we observed in the spiking activity and local field potentials of the AC and the PFC combined coincided with the time course of the large-scale MMN-like signals reported in the rat brain, thereby linking the microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic levels of automatic deviance detection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.(ACC)Anterior cingulate cortex(ABR)auditory brainstem responses(AC)auditory cortex(CTR)control condition(DEV)deviant condition(ECoG)electrocorticography(ERP)event-related potential(FDR)false discovery rate(FRA)frequency response area(iMM)index of neuronal mismatch(iPE)index of prediction error(iRS)index of repetition suppression(IC)inferior colliculus(IL)infralimbic cortex(LFP)local field potentials(MGB)medial geniculate body(mPFC)medial prefrontal cortex(MMN)mismatch negativity(PE)prediction error(PE-LFP)prediction error potential(PFC)prefrontal cortex(PL)prelimbic cortex(M2)secondary motor cortex(STD)standard condition(SEM)standard error of the mean.},

	abstract = {To make optimal decisions in uncertain circumstances flexible adaption of behaviour is required; exploring alternatives when the best choice is unknown, exploiting what is known when that is best. Using a detailed computational model of the basal ganglia, we propose that switches between exploratory and exploitative decisions can be mediated by the interaction between tonic dopamine and cortical input to the basal ganglia. We show that a biologically detailed action selection circuit model of the basal ganglia, endowed with dopamine dependant striatal plasticity, can optimally solve the explore-exploit problem, estimating the true underlying state of a noisy Gaussian diffusion process. Critical to the model{\textquoteright}s performance was a fluctuating level of tonic dopamine which increased under conditions of uncertainty. With an optimal range of tonic dopamine, explore-exploit decision making was mediated by the effects of tonic dopamine on the precision of the model action selection mechanism. Under conditions of uncertain reward pay-out, the model{\textquoteright}s reduced selectivity allowed disinhibition of multiple alternative actions to be explored at random. Conversely, when uncertainly about reward pay-out was low, enhanced selectivity of the action selection circuit was enhanced, facilitating exploitation of the high value choice. When integrated with phasic dopamine dependant influences on cortico-striatal plasticity, the model{\textquoteright}s performance was at the level of the Kalman filter which provides an optimal solution for the task. Our model provides an integrative account of the relationship between phasic and tonic dopamine and the action selection function of the basal ganglia and supports the idea that this subcortical neural circuit may have evolved to facilitate decision making in non-stationary reward environments, allowing a number of experimental predictions with relevance to abnormal decision making in neuropsychiatric and neurological disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.MSNMedium Spiny NeuronRPEReward Prediction ErrorGPeGlobus Pallidus externaGPiGlobus Pallidus internaD1RDopamine receptor type 1D2RDopamine receptor type 2LTPLong Term PotentiationLTDLong Term Depression},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that predicted tactile action outcomes are perceptually attenuated. The present experiments determined whether predictive mechanisms always generate attenuation, or instead can enhance perception {\textendash} as typically observed in sensory cognition domains outside of action. We manipulated probabilistic expectations in a paradigm often used to demonstrate tactile attenuation. Participants produced actions and subsequently rated the intensity of forces on a passive finger. Experiment 1 confirmed previous findings that action outcomes are perceived less intensely than passive stimulation, but demonstrated more intense perception when active finger stimulation was removed. Experiments 2 and 3 manipulated prediction explicitly and found that expected touch during action is perceived more intensely than unexpected touch. Computational modelling suggested that expectations increase the gain afforded to expected tactile signals. These findings challenge a central tenet of prominent motor control theories and demonstrate that sensorimotor predictions do not exhibit a qualitatively distinct influence on tactile perception.Statement of Relevance Perception of expected action outcomes is thought to be attenuated. Such a mechanism may be adaptive because surprising inputs are more useful - e.g., signalling the need to take new courses of action - and is thought to explain why we cannot tickle ourselves and unusual aspects of action and awareness in clinical populations. However, theories outside of action purport that predicted events are perceptually facilitated, allowing us to generate largely accurate representations of our noisy sensory world. We do not know whether action predictions really alter perception differently from other predictions because different manipulations have been performed. Here we perform similar manipulations and demonstrate that action predictions can enhance, rather than attenuate, touch. We thereby demonstrate that action predictions may not have a qualitatively distinct influence on perception, such that we must re-examine theories concerning how predictions influence perception across domains and clinical theories based upon their assumptions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In a tumour setting, macrophages encompass a spectrum between a tumour-suppressive (M1) or tumour-promoting (M2) state. The biology of macrophages found in tumours (Tumour Associated Macrophages) remains unclear, but understanding their impact on tumour progression is highly important. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of a macrophage polarization network, following two lines of enquiry: (i) we reconstruct the macrophage polarization network based on literature, extending it to include important stimuli in a tumour setting, and (ii) we build a dynamical model able to reproduce macrophage polarization in the presence of different stimuli, including the contact with cancer cells. Our simulations recapitulate the documented macrophage phenotypes and their dependencies on specific receptors and transcription factors, while also elucidating the formation of a special type of tumour associated macrophages in an in-vitro model of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. This model constitutes the first step towards elucidating the cross-talk between immune and cancer cells inside tumours, with the ultimate goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that could control the formation of tumour associated macrophages in patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Action is a medium of collecting sensory information about the environment, which in turn is shaped by architectural affordances. Affordances characterize the fit between the physical structure of the body and capacities for movement and interaction with the environment, thus relying on sensorimotor processes associated with exploring the surroundings. Central to sensorimotor brain dynamics, the attentional mechanisms directing the gating function of sensory signals share neuronal resources with motor-related processes necessary to inferring the external causes of sensory signals. Such a predictive coding approach suggests that sensorimotor dynamics are sensitive to architectural affordances that support or suppress specific kinds of actions for an individual. However, how architectural affordances relate to the attentional mechanisms underlying the gating function for sensory signals remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that event-related desynchronization of alpha-band oscillations in parieto-occipital and medio-temporal regions covary with the architectural affordances. Source-level time-frequency analysis of data recorded in a motor-priming Mobile Brain/Body Imaging experiment revealed strong event-related desynchronization of the alpha band to originate from the posterior cingulate complex and bilateral parahippocampal areas. Our results firstly contribute to the understanding of how the brain resolves architectural affordances relevant to behaviour. Second, our results indicate that the alpha-band originating from the posterior cingulate complex covaries with the architectural affordances before participants interact with the environment. During the interaction, the bilateral parahippocampal areas dynamically reflect the affordable behaviour as perceived through the visual system. We conclude that the sensorimotor dynamics are developed for processing behaviour-relevant features in the designed environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Individual fingers in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are known to be represented separately and adjacently, forming a cortical hand map. Electrophysiological studies in monkeys show that finger amputation triggers increased selectivity to the neighbouring fingers within the deprived S1, causing local reorganisation. Neuroimaging research in humans, however, shows persistent S1 finger representation of the missing hand, even decades after amputation. We aimed to resolve these apparently contrasting evidence by examining finger representation in humans following pharmacological {\textquoteleft}amputation{\textquoteright} using single-finger nerve block and 7T neuroimaging. We hypothesised that beneath the apparent selectivity of individual fingers in the hand map, peripheral and central processing is distributed across fingers. If each finger contributes to the cortical representation of the others, then localised input loss will weaken finger representation across the hand map. For the same reason, the non-blocked fingers will stabilise the blocked finger{\textquoteright}s representation, resulting in persistent representation of the blocked finger. Using univariate selectivity profiling, we replicated the electrophysiological findings of local S1 reorganisation. However, more comprehensive analyses confirmed that local blocking reduced representation of all fingers across the entire hand area. Importantly, multivariate analysis demonstrated that despite input loss, representation of the blocked finger remained persistent and distinct from the unblocked fingers. Computational modelling suggested that the observed findings are driven by distributed processing underlying the topographic map, combined with homeostatic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the long-standing depiction of the somatosensory hand map is misleading. As such, accounts for map reorganisation, e.g. following amputation, need to be reconsidered.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Selecting hand actions to manipulate an object is affected both by perceptual factors and by action goals. Affordances are associated with the automatic potentiation of motor representations to an object, independent of the goal of the actor. In previous studies, we have demonstrated an influence of the congruency between hand and object orientations on response times when reaching to turn an object, such as a cup. In this study, we investigated how the representation of hand postures triggered by planning to turn a cup were influenced by this congruency effect, in an fMRI scanning environment. Healthy participants were asked to reach and turn a real cup that was placed in front of them either in an upright orientation or upside down. They were instructed to use a hand orientation that was either congruent or incongruent with the cup orientation. As expected, the motor responses were faster when the hand and cup orientations were congruent. There was increased activity in a network of brain regions involving object-directed actions during action planning, which included bilateral primary and extrastriate visual, medial and superior temporal areas, as well as superior parietal, primary motor and premotor areas in the left hemisphere. Specific activation of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) was associated with hand-object orientation congruency during planning, and prior to any action taking place. Activity in that area and its connectivity with the lateral occipito-temporal cortex (LOTC) increased when planning incongruent actions. The increased activity in premotor areas in trials where the orientation of the hand was incongruent to that of the object suggests a role in eliciting competing representations specified by hand postures in LOTC.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Slow-timescale (tonic) changes in dopamine (DA) contribute to a wide variety of processes in reinforcement learning, interval timing, and other domains. Furthermore, changes in tonic DA exert distinct effects depending on when they occur (e.g., during learning vs. performance) and what task the subject is performing (e.g., operant vs. classical conditioning). Two influential theories of tonic DA{\textemdash}the average reward theory and the Bayesian theory in which DA controls precision{\textemdash}have each been successful at explaining a subset of empirical findings. But how the same DA signal performs two seemingly distinct functions without creating crosstalk is not well understood. Here we reconcile the two theories under the unifying framework of {\textquoteleft}rational inattention,{\textquoteright} which (1) conceptually links average reward and precision, (2) outlines how DA manipulations affect this relationship, and in so doing, (3) captures new empirical phenomena. In brief, rational inattention asserts that agents can increase their precision in a task (and thus improve their performance) by paying a cognitive cost. Crucially, whether this cost is worth paying depends on average reward availability, reported by DA. The monotonic relationship between average reward and precision means that the DA signal contains the information necessary to retrieve the precision. When this information is needed after the task is performed, as presumed by Bayesian inference, acute manipulations of DA will bias behavior in predictable ways. We show how this framework reconciles a remarkably large collection of experimental findings. In reinforcement learning, the rational inattention framework predicts that learning from positive and negative feedback should be enhanced in high and low DA states, respectively, and that DA should tip the exploration-exploitation balance toward exploitation. In interval timing, this framework predicts that DA should increase the speed of the internal clock and decrease the extent of interference by other temporal stimuli during temporal reproduction (the central tendency effect). Finally, rational inattention makes the new predictions that these effects should be critically dependent on the controllability of rewards, that post-reward delays in intertemporal choice tasks should be underestimated, and that average reward manipulations should affect the speed of the clock{\textemdash}thus capturing empirical findings that are unexplained by either theory alone. Our results suggest that a common computational repertoire may underlie the seemingly heterogeneous roles of DA.Author Summary The roles of tonic dopamine (DA) have been the subject of much speculation, partly due to the variety of processes it has been implicated in. For instance, tonic DA modulates how we learn new information, but also affects how previously learned information is used. DA affects the speed of our internal timing mechanism, but also modulates the degree to which our temporal estimates are influenced by context. DA improves performance in some tasks, but seems only to affect confidence in others. Are there common principles that govern the role of DA across these domains? In this work, we introduce the concept of {\textquoteleft}rational inattention,{\textquoteright} originally borrowed from economics, to the DA literature. We show how the rational inattention account of DA unites two influential theories that are seemingly at odds: the average reward theory and the Bayesian theory of tonic DA. We then show how this framework reconciles the diverse roles of DA, which cannot be addressed by either theory alone.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The pressure of our own finger on the arm feels differently than the same pressure exerted by an external agent: the latter involves just touch, whereas the former involves a combination of touch and predictive output from the internal model of the body. This internal model predicts the movement of our own finger and hence the intensity of the sensation of the finger press is decreased. A decrease in intensity of the self-produced stimulus is called sensory attenuation. It has been reported that, due to decreased somatosensation with age and an increased reliance on the prediction of the internal model, sensory attenuation is increased in older adults.In this study, we used a force-matching paradigm to test if sensory attenuation is also present over the arm and if aging increases sensory attenuation. We demonstrated that, while both young and older adults overestimate a self-produced force, older adults overestimate it even more showing an increased sensory attenuation. In addition, we also found that both younger and older adults self-produce higher forces when activating the homologous muscles of the upper limb.While this is traditionally viewed as evidence for an increased reliance on internal model function in older adults because of decreased somatosensory function, somatosensation appeared unimpaired in our older participants. This begs the question of whether the decreased somatosensation is really responsible for the increased sensory attenuation observed in older people.New and Noteworthy Forces generated externally (by the environment on the participant) and internally (by the participant on her/his body) are not perceived with the same intensity. Internally-generated forces are perceived less intensely than externally generated ones. This difference in force sensation has been shown to be higher in elderly participants when the forces were applied on the fingers because of their impaired somatosensation. Here we replicated this finding for the arm but suggest that it is unlikely linked to impaired somatosensory function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Besides providing data in support of an evidence-related signal in a social cognition task, we were interested in embedding these neural correlates in models of supramodal associative cortex placed at the top of a hierarchy of processing areas. Participants were asked to decide which of two depicted individuals was saddest based on information rich in sensory features (facial expressions) or through contextual cues suggesting the mental state of others (stylized drawings of mourning individuals). The signal associated with evidence for the decision was located in two distinct networks differentially recruited depending on the information type. Using the largest peaks of the signal associated with evidence as seeds in a database of connectivity data, these two networks were retrieved. Furthermore, the hubs of these networks were located near or along a ribbon of cortex located between task activations and deactivations between areas affected by perceptual priming and the deactivated areas of the default network system. In associative cortex, these findings suggest gradients of progressive relative deactivation as a possible neural correlate of the cortical organization envisaged by structural models of cortical organization and by predictive coding theories of cortical function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The global neuronal workspace (GNW) model has inspired over two decades of hypothesis driven research on the neural basis consciousness. However, recent studies have reported findings that are at odds with empirical predictions of the model. Further, the macro-anatomical focus of current GNW research has limited the specificity of predictions afforded by the model. In this paper we present a neurocomputational model {\textendash} based on Active Inference {\textendash} that captures central architectural elements of the GNW and is able to address these limitations. The resulting {\textquoteleft}predictive global workspace{\textquoteright} casts neuronal dynamics as approximating Bayesian inference, allowing precise, testable predictions at both the behavioural and neural levels of description. We report simulations demonstrating the model{\textquoteright}s ability to reproduce: 1) the electrophysiological and behaviour results observed in previous studies of inattentional blindness; and 2) the previously introduced four-way taxonomy predicted by the GNW, which describes the relationship between consciousness, attention, and sensory signal strength. We then illustrate how our model can reconcile/explain (apparently) conflicting findings, extend the GNW taxonomy to include the influence of prior expectations, and inspire novel paradigms to test associated behavioural and neural predictions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Individual differences in perception are widespread. Considering inter-individual variability, synesthetes experience stable additional sensations; schizophrenia patients suffer perceptual deficits in e.g. perceptual organization (alongside hallucinations and delusions). Is there a unifying principle explaining inter-individual variability in perception? There is good reason to believe perceptual experience results from inferential processes whereby sensory evidence is weighted by prior knowledge about the world. Different perceptual phenotypes may result from different precision weighting of sensory evidence and prior knowledge. We tested this hypothesis by comparing visibility thresholds in a perceptual hysteresis task across medicated schizophrenia patients, synesthetes, and controls. Participants rated the subjective visibility of stimuli embedded in noise while we parametrically manipulated the availability of sensory evidence. Additionally, precise long-term priors in synesthetes were leveraged by presenting either synesthesia-inducing or neutral stimuli. Schizophrenia patients showed increased visibility thresholds, consistent with overreliance on sensory evidence. In contrast, synesthetes exhibited lowered thresholds exclusively for synesthesia-inducing stimuli suggesting high-precision long-term priors. Additionally, in both synesthetes and schizophrenia patients explicit, short-term priors {\textendash} introduced during the hysteresis experiment {\textendash} lowered thresholds but did not normalize perception. Our results imply that distinct perceptual phenotypes might result from differences in the precision afforded to prior beliefs and sensory evidence, respectively.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Many deleterious behaviors, such as procrastinating on urgent matters or sustaining a toxic relationship, are irrational. But is irrational behavior the incidental outcome of biological constraints imposed on neural information processing? In particular, can those constraints alter decisions, even when people know the consequences of alternative actions? Recent studies indicate that orbitofrontal neurons encode decision value in relative terms, i.e. value signals in OFC neurons are normalized with respect to the context. Value-based decisions may thus exhibit irrational context-dependence effects. A candidate explanation is {\textquotedblleft}efficient coding{\textquotedblright}: OFC neurons may mitigate information loss by adapting their (bounded) output firing properties to the recent value range. This is seducing, because it suggests that relative value coding is the brain{\textquoteright}s best attempt to produce rational behavior, given its own hard-wired biological constraints. However, whether the behavioral implications of this scenario are met, how it generalizes to realistic situations in which OFC neurons construct value from multiple decision-relevant attributes, and what its neurophysiological bases are, is unclear. Here, we address these issues by re-analyzing two open fMRI datasets from the OpenNeuro.org initiative, where people have to integrate prospective gains and losses to decide whether to gamble or not. First, we show that peoples{\textquoteright} risk attitudes critically depend on the range of gain prospects they are exposed to. Importantly, counter to simple efficient coding scenarios, differences in gain ranges induce progressive changes in peoples{\textquoteright} sensitivity to both gains and losses. Second, we use artificial neural network models to show that hebbian rewiring processes between attribute-specific and attribute-integration neurons predict (out-of-sample) both context-dependence effects in peoples{\textquoteright} risk attitude and multivariate patterns of fMRI activity in the OFC. Under mild conditions on distributed population codes for decision attributes, hebbian plasticity eventually translates the distribution of reweighted attribute signals towards the responsive range of integration neurons. In turn, integration units exhibit the known features of range adaptation, including (but not limited to), relative value coding. Our results demonstrate how hebbian plasticity within brain networks may result in range adaptation, eventually yielding complex though predictable irrational behavior.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {In everyday life, our behavior varies on a continuum from automatic and habitual to deliberate and goal-directed. Recent evidence suggests that habit formation and relearning of habits operate in a context-dependent manner: Habit formation is promoted when actions are performed in a specific context, while breaking off habits is facilitated after a context change. It is an open question how one can computationally model the brain{\textquoteright}s balancing between context-specific habits and goal-directed actions. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach for control of a partially observable Markov decision process that enables conjoint learning of habits and reward structure in a context-specific manner. In this model, habit learning corresponds to an updating of priors over policies and interacts with the learning of the outcome contingencies. Importantly, the model is solely built on probabilistic inference, which effectively provides a simple explanation of how the brain may balance contributions of habitual and goal-directed control. We illustrated the resulting behavior using agent-based simulated experiments, where we replicated several findings of devaluation, extinction, and renewal experiments, as well as the so-called two-step task which is typically used with human participants. In addition, we show how a single parameter, the habitual tendency, can explain individual differences in habit learning and the balancing between habitual and goal-directed control. Finally, we discuss the link of the proposed model to other habit learning models and implications for understanding specific phenomena in substance use disorder.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However empirical evidence for differences in low-level sensorimotor predictions in autism is still lacking. One approach to examining predictive processing in the sensorimotor domain is in the context of self-generated (predictable) as opposed to externally-generated (less predictable) effects. We employed two complementary tasks {\textendash} force-matching and intentional binding {\textendash} which examine self-versus externally-generated action effects in terms of sensory attenuation and attentional binding respectively in adults with and without autism. The results show that autism was associated with normal levels of sensory attenuation of internally-generated force and with unaltered temporal attraction of voluntary actions and their outcomes. Thus, our results do not support a general deficit in predictive processing in autism.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Finally, decision acuity was reliable and its relationship with functional connectivity was stable when measured in the same individuals 18 months later.

In this study, we employed resting-state fMRI to assess experience-dependent differences in insula co-activation patterns between conservatory-trained singers and non-singers. Results indicate enhanced bilateral insula connectivity in singers relative to non-singers with constituents of the speech sensorimotor network in both hemispheres. Specifically, with the cerebellum (lobule VI, crus 2), primary somatosensory cortex, the parietal lobes, and the thalamus. Furthermore, singing training predicted enhanced bilateral co-activation of primary sensorimotor areas representing the larynx (with left dorsal anterior insula, dAI) and the diaphragm (with bilateral dAI){\textemdash}crucial regions for cortico-motor control of complex vocalizations, as well as the thalamus (with bilateral posterior insula/left dAI) and the left putamen (with left dAI). Together, these data support a crucial role of the insula in respiratory and laryngeal control and suggest that singing experience enhances the integration of somatosensory information within the speech motor system, perhaps by strengthening salient associations of bodily signals associated with conscious and non-conscious aspects of expressive language production within a musical framework.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Under covert attention, our visual perception deteriorates dramatically as eccentricity increases. This reduction of peripheral visual acuity (PVA) is partially due to the coarse sampling of the retinal ganglion cells towards the periphery, but this property cannot be solely responsible. Other factors, such as character crowding, have been studied, yet the origin of the poor PVA is not entirely understood. This gap motivated us to investigate the PVA by varying the crowding conditions systematically. Under completely crowded conditions (i.e. resembling a full page of text), PVA was observed to be eight times worse than the PVA under uncrowded conditions. By partially crowding the periphery, we obtained PVA values between the fully crowded and uncrowded conditions. On the other hand, crowding the fovea center while leaving the periphery uncrowded improved PVA relative to the uncrowded case. These results support a model for a top-down {\textquotedblleft}covert attention vector{\textquotedblright} that assists the resulting PVA in a manner analogous to saccadic eye movement for overt attention. We speculate that the attention vector instructs the dorsal pathway to transform the peripheral character to the foveal center. Then, the scale-invariant log-polar retinotopy of the ventral pathway can scale the centered visual input to match the prior memory of the specific character shape.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The initial encoding of visual information primarily from the contralateral visual field is a fundamental organizing principle of the primate visual system. Recently, the presence of such retinotopic sensitivity has been shown to extend well beyond early visual cortex to regions not historically considered retinotopically sensitive. In particular, human scene-selective regions in parahippocampal and medial parietal cortex exhibit prominent biases for the contralateral visual field. Here we used fMRI to test the hypothesis that the human hippocampus, which is thought to be anatomically connected with these scene-selective regions, would also exhibit a biased representation of contralateral visual space. First, population receptive field mapping with scene stimuli revealed strong biases for the contralateral visual field in bilateral hippocampus. Second, the distribution of retinotopic sensitivity suggested a more prominent representation in anterior medial portions of the hippocampus. Finally, the contralateral bias was confirmed in independent data taken from the Human Connectome Project initiative. The presence of contralateral biases in the hippocampus {\textendash} a structure considered by many as the apex of the visual hierarchy - highlights the truly pervasive influence of retinotopy. Moreover, this finding has important implications for understanding how this information relates to the allocentric global spatial representations known to be encoded therein.Significance Statement Retinotopic encoding of visual information is an organizing principle of visual cortex. Recent work demonstrates this sensitivity in structures far beyond early visual cortex, including those anatomically connected to the hippocampus. Here, using population receptive field modelling in two independent sets of data we demonstrate a consistent bias for the contralateral visual field in bilateral hippocampus.

	abstract = {Different pathway analysis methods are frequently applied to cancer gene expression data to identify dysregulated pathways. In most cases these methods infer pathway activity changes based on the gene expression of pathway members. However, pathways are constituted by signaling proteins, and their activity - not their abundance - defines the activity of the pathway; the association between gene expression and protein activity is in turn limited and not well characterised. Other methods infer pathway activity from the expression of the genes whose transcription is regulated by the pathway of interest, which seems a more adequate proxy of activity. Despite these potential limitations, membership based pathway methods are frequently used and often provide statistically significant results.Here, we submit that pathway based methods are not effective because of the correlation between the gene expression of pathway members and the activity of the pathway, but because pathway member gene sets overlap with the genes regulated by transcription factors (regulons). This implies that pathway methods do not inform about the activity of the pathway of interest, but instead the downstream effects of changes in the activities of transcription factors.To support our hypothesis, we show that the higher the overlap to transcription factor regulons, the higher the information value of pathway gene sets. Furthermore, removing these overlapping genes reduces the information content of pathway gene sets, but not vice versa. Our results suggest that results of classical pathway analysis methods should be interpreted with caution, and instead methods using pathway regulated genes for activity inference should be prioritised.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

In an infleuntial model, selfhood relates to internal agency and higher-order interoceptive representation, inferred from the predicted impact of efferent autonomic nerves on afferent viscerosensory feedback. Here we tested if an altered representation of physical self (illusory embodiment of an artificial hand) is accompanied by sustained shifts in autonomic activity.Participants (N=37) underwent procedures for induction of the rubber hand illusion (synchronous stroking of own unseen hand and observed stroking of artificial hand) and a control condition (asychronous stroking). We recorded electrodermal activity, electrocardiography, and non-invasive measurement of multiunit skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) from the chest. We compared measures between task conditions, and between individuals who did and did not experience the illusion. Bayes factors quantified the strength of evidence for and against null hypotheses.Subjective reports and observed proprioceptive drift confirmed the efficacy of synchronous vs asynchronous condition in inducing illusory hand ownership. Stringent discriminant analysis classified 24 /37 individuals as experiencing the rubber hand illusion. Electrodermal activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, and SKNA measures revealed no autonomic differences between synchronous vs asynchronous conditions, nor between individuals who did or did not experience the rubber hand illusion. Bayes factors confirmed there was substantial evidence for no physiological differences.In contrast to earlier reports, our cardiac and electrodermal autonomic data, including fine grained SKNA measurement, provide substantial evidence for the absence of a reliable change in physiological state during induction or experience of the rubber hand illusion. If illusory body ownership is coupled to, or facilitated by, changes in efferent autonomic activity and afferent viscerosensory feedback, our findings suggest that such changes in bodily physiology are not sustained as an obligatory component of the illusion.},

We calculated the harmonic modes of the brain{\textquoteright}s functional connectivity, called {\textquotedblleft}functional harmonics{\textquotedblright}, from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in resting state of 812 participants. Each functional harmonic provides an elementary pattern of brain activity with a different spatial frequency. The set of all functional harmonics - ordered according to their spatial frequencies - can reconstruct any pattern of brain activity. The activity patterns elicited by 7 different tasks from the Human Connectome Project can be reconstructed from a very small subset of functional harmonics, suggesting a novel relationship between task and resting state brain activity. Further, the isolines of the continuous functional harmonic patterns delineate the borders of specialized cortical areas as well as somatotopic and retinotopic organization.

	abstract = {Making accurate decisions in uncertain environments requires identifying the generative cause of sensory cues, but also the expected outcomes of possible actions. Although both cognitive processes can be formalized as Bayesian inference, they are commonly studied using different experimental frameworks, making their formal comparison difficult. Here, by framing a reversal learning task either as cue-based or outcome-based inference, we found that humans perceive the same volatile environment as more stable when inferring its hidden state by interaction with uncertain outcomes than by observation of equally uncertain cues. Multivariate patterns of magnetoencephalo-graphic (MEG) activity reflected this behavioral difference in the neural interaction between inferred beliefs and incoming evidence, an effect originating from associative regions in the temporal lobe. Together, these findings indicate that the degree of control over the sampling of volatile environments shapes human learning and decision-making under uncertainty.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Asthma is one of many chronic diseases in which discordance between objectively measured pathophysiology and symptom burden is well recognised. Understanding the influences on symptom burden beyond pathophysiology could improve our ability to treat symptoms. While co-morbidities such as anxiety and depression may play a role, the impact of this relationship with symptoms on our ability to perceive bodily sensations (termed {\textquoteleft}interoception{\textquoteright}), or even our general and symptom-specific attention is not yet understood. Here we studied 63 individuals with asthma and 30 healthy controls. Alongside physiological tests including spirometry, bronchodilator responsiveness, expired nitric oxide and blood eosinophils, we collected self-reported questionnaires covering affective factors such as anxiety and depression, as well as asthma symptoms and asthma-related quality of life (individuals with asthma only). Participants additionally completed a breathing-related interoception task and two attention tasks designed to measure responsiveness to general temporal/spatial cues and specific asthma-related threatening words. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis across the questionnaires which gave rise to key components of {\textquoteleft}Mood{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}Symptoms{\textquoteright}, and compared these to physiological, interoceptive and attention measures. While no relationships were found between symptoms and physiological measures in asthma alone, negative mood was related to both decreased interoceptive metacognitive sensitivity ({\textquoteleft}insight{\textquoteright} into interoceptive performance) and metacognitive bias (confidence in interoceptive decisions), as well as increased effects of spatial orienting cues in both asthma and controls. Furthermore, the relationship between the extent of symptoms and negative mood revealed potential sub-groups within asthma, with those who displayed the most severe symptoms without concurrent negative mood also demonstrating altered physiological, interoceptive and attention measures. Our findings are a step towards understanding how both symptoms and mood are related to our ability to interpret bodily symptoms, and to explore how the balance between mood and symptoms may help us understand the heterogeneity in conditions such as asthma.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, cortical areas may also communicate indirectly via higher-order nuclei in the thalamus, such as the pulvinar or lateral posterior nucleus (LP) in the visual system. The fine-scale organization and function of these cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways remains unclear. We find that responses of mouse LP neurons projecting to higher visual areas likely derive from feedforward input from primary visual cortex (V1) combined with information from many cortical and subcortical areas, including superior colliculus. Signals from LP projections to different higher visual areas are tuned to specific features of visual stimuli and their locomotor context, distinct from the signals carried by direct intracortical projections from V1. Thus, visual transthalamic pathways are functionally specific to their cortical target, different from feedforward cortical pathways and combine information from multiple brain regions, linking sensory signals with behavioral context.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Aphasia recovery post-stroke is classically and most commonly hypothesised to rely on regions that were not involved in language premorbidly, through {\textquoteleft}neurocomputational invasion{\textquoteright} or engagement of {\textquoteleft}quiescent homologues{\textquoteright}. Contemporary accounts have suggested, instead, that recovery might be supported by under-utilised areas of the premorbid language network, which are downregulated in health to save neural resources ({\textquoteleft}variable neurodisplacement{\textquoteright}). Despite the importance of understanding the neural bases of language recovery clinically and theoretically, there is no consensus as to which specific regions are activated more consistently in post-stroke aphasia (PSA) than healthy individuals. Accordingly, we performed an Activation Likelihood Estimation analysis of language functional neuroimaging studies in PSA and linked control data. We obtained coordinate-based functional neuroimaging data for 481 individuals with aphasia following left hemisphere stroke (one third of which was previously unpublished) and for 530 healthy controls. Instead of the language network expanding by activating novel right hemisphere regions {\textquoteleft}de novo{\textquoteright} post-stroke, as would be predicted by neurocomputational invasion/quiescent homologue engagement mechanisms of recovery, we found that multiple regions throughout both hemispheres were consistently activated during language tasks in PSA and controls. Multiple undamaged regions were less consistently activated in PSA than controls, including domain-general regions of medial superior frontal cortex and right fronto-temporal cortex. In the reverse direction, the right anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus were more consistently activated in PSA than controls, particularly for executively-demanding comprehension tasks. These regions overlap with control networks known to be recruited during difficult tasks in healthy individuals and were more consistently activated by patients during higher than lower demand tasks in this meta-analysis. Overall, these findings run counter to neurocomputational invasion of the language network into new territory or engagement of quiescent homologues. Instead, many parts of the pre-existing language network are less consistently activated in PSA, except for more consistent use of spare capacity within right hemisphere executive-control related regions (cf. variable neurodisplacement). This study provides novel insights into the language network changes that occur post-stroke. Such knowledge is essential if we are to design neurobiologically-informed therapeutic interventions to facilitate language recovery.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Cognitive maps are mental representations of spatial and conceptual relationships in an environment. These maps are critical for flexible behavior as they permit us to navigate vicariously, but their underlying representation learning mechanisms are still unknown. To form these abstract maps, hippocampus has to learn to separate or merge aliased observations appropriately in different contexts in a manner that enables generalization, efficient planning, and handling of uncertainty. Here we introduce a specific higher-order graph structure {\textendash} clone-structured cognitive graph (CSCG) {\textendash} which forms different clones of an observation for different contexts as a representation that addresses these problems. CSCGs can be learned efficiently using a novel probabilistic sequence model that is inherently robust to uncertainty. We show that CSCGs can explain a variety cognitive map phenomena such as discovering spatial relations from an aliased sensory stream, transitive inference between disjoint episodes of experiences, formation of transferable structural knowledge, and shortcut-finding in novel environments. By learning different clones for different contexts, CSCGs explain the emergence of splitter cells and route-specific encoding of place cells observed in maze navigation, and event-specific graded representations observed in lap-running experiments. Moreover, learning and inference dynamics of CSCGs offer a coherent explanation for a variety of place cell remapping phenomena. By lifting the aliased observations into a hidden space, CSCGs reveal latent modularity that is then used for hierarchical abstraction and planning. Altogether, learning and inference using a CSCG provides a simple unifying framework for understanding hippocampal function, and could be a pathway for forming relational abstractions in artificial intelligence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The ability to infer agency is particularly challenging under conditions of uncertainty.

Here we use a novel, temporally-sensitive, behavioural proxy for prediction error to show that it is minimised most quickly when variability is low, but also when volatility is high. Further, when human participants report agency, they show steeper prediction error minimisation. We demonstrate broad effects of uncertainty on accuracy of agency judgements, movement, policy selection, and hypothesis switching. Measuring autism traits, we find differences in policy selection, sensitivity to uncertainty and hypothesis switching despite no difference in overall accuracy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Under both conditions, we subjected participants to several well-established experimental conscious-perception paradigms, such as backward masking and the attentional blink task.Results We found no evidence in support of an effect of cabergoline on conscious perception: key behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) findings associated with each of these tasks were unaffected by cabergoline.Conclusions Our results cast doubt on a causal role for dopamine in visual perception.

Intriguingly, the interval statistics of these alternations exhibits quasi-universal characteristics, suggesting a general mechanism. Here we show that the stereotypical features of multistable perception, exemplified by binocular rivalry, are reproduced in detail by a hierarchical dynamics operating out of equilibrium. Its constitutive elements are discretely stochastic and idealize the metastability of cortical networks. Independent elements accumulate visual evidence at one level, while groups of coupled elements compete for dominance at another level. As soon as one group dominates perception, feedback inhibition suppresses supporting evidence. This mechanism is corroborated compellingly by unexpected serial dependencies of perceptual alternations. Moreover, it satisfies normative constraints of continuous decision-making. We conclude that multistable perception reflects decision-making in a volatile world: integrating evidence over space and time, choosing categorically between hypotheses, while concurrently evaluating alternatives.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging is now widely used to infer neuronal dynamics from changes in fluorescence of an indicator. However, state of the art computational tools are not optimized for the reliable detection of fluorescence transients from highly synchronous neurons located in densely packed regions such as the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus during early postnatal stages of development. Indeed, the latest analytical tools often lack proper benchmark measurements. To meet this challenge, we first developed a graphical user interface allowing for a precise manual detection of all calcium transients from imaged neurons based on the visualization of the calcium imaging movie. Then, we analyzed the movies using a convolutional neural network with an attention process and a bidirectional long-short term memory network. This method is able to reach human performance and offers a better F1 score (harmonic mean of sensitivity and precision) than CaImAn to infer neural activity in the developing CA1 without any user intervention. It also enables automatically identifying activity originating from GABAergic neurons. Overall, DeepCINAC offers a simple, fast and flexible open-source toolbox for processing a wide variety of calcium imaging datasets while providing the tools to evaluate its performance.Significance statement Inferring neuronal activity from calcium imaging data remains a challenge due to the difficulty in obtaining a ground truth using patch clamp recordings and the problem of finding optimal tuning parameters of inference algorithms.

	abstract = {Background The activity of a transcription factor (TF) in a sample of cells is the extent to which it is exerting its regulatory potential. Many methods of inferring TF activity from gene expression data have been described, but due to the lack of appropriate large-scale datasets, systematic and objective validation has not been possible until now.Results Using a new dataset, we systematically evaluate and optimize the approach to TF activity inference in which a gene expression matrix is factored into a condition-independent matrix of control strengths and a condition-dependent matrix of TF activity levels. These approaches require a TF network map, which specifies the target genes of each TF, as input. We evaluate different approaches to building the network map and deriving constraints on the matrices. We find that such constraints are essential for good performance. Constraints can be obtained from expression data in which the activities of individual TFs have been perturbed, and we find that such data are both necessary and sufficient for obtaining good performance. Remaining uncertainty about whether a TF activates or represses a target is a major source of error. To a considerable extent, control strengths inferred using expression data from one growth condition carry over to other conditions. As a result, the control strength matrices derived here can be used for other applications. Finally, we apply these methods to gain insight into the upstream factors that regulate the activities of four yeast TFs: Gcr2, Gln3, Gcn4, and Msn2. Evaluation code and data available at https://github.com/BrentLab/TFA-evaluationConclusions When a high-quality network map, constraints, and perturbation-response data are available, inferring TF activity levels by factoring gene expression matrices is effective.

Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) learning paradigm in non-human primates, we identified large fluctuations in neural population activity in motor cortex (M1) indicative of arousal-like internal state changes. These fluctuations drove population activity along dimensions we term neural engagement axes. Neural engagement increased abruptly at the start of learning, and then gradually retreated.

	abstract = {Somatic inputs originating from bioregulatory processes can guide cognition and behavior. One such bodily signal, mostly overlooked so far, is represented by visuo-vestibular coupling and its alteration, which in extreme cases may result in motion sickness. We argued that the inherently perturbed interoceptive state that follows can be a powerful determinant of human motivated behavior, resulting in a blunted response to appetitive stimuli and an exaggerated response to noxious ones. We sought to assess such differential impact of visuo-vestibular mismatches on value through a task involving conflict monitoring. We therefore administered to 42 healthy participants a modified version of the Flankers task, in which distractors (arrows, pointing in either a congruent or incongruent direction) signaled the availability of monetary incentives (gains, losses, or neutral trials). While performing the task, participants received either galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), or sham stimulation. We have found impaired behavioral performances when value, which was attached to task-irrelevant information, was at stake. Gains and losses, interestingly, dissociated, and only the latter caused enhanced interference costs in the task, suggesting that negative incentives may be more effective in capturing human attention than positive ones. Finally, we have found some weak evidence for GVS to further increase the processing of losses, as suggested by even larger interference costs in this condition. Results were, however, overall ambiguous, and suggest that much more research is needed to better understand the link between the vestibular system and motivation.HighlightsVisuo-Vestibular mismatches may be important somatic markers affecting the evaluation of reinforcers;When attached to distractors, value information impairs behavioral performance for the task at hand;Trials in which potential losses were at stake were associated with larger interference costs arising from conflicting information between the target and the flankers;GVS (Right-Anodal) may further increase the interference caused by losses, but the evidence in this respect was ambiguous and inconclusive;Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Several theories propose that emotions and self-awareness arise from the integration of internal and external signals and their respective precision-weighted expectations. Supporting these mechanisms, research indicates that the brain uses temporal cues from cardiac signals to predict auditory stimuli, and that these predictions and their prediction errors can be observed in the scalp heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP). We investigated the effect of precision modulations on these cross-modal predictive mechanisms, via attention and interoceptive ability. We presented auditory sequences at short (perceived synchronous) or long (perceived asynchronous) cardio-audio delays, with half of the trials including an omission. Participants attended to the cardio-audio synchronicity of the tones (internal attention) or the auditory stimuli alone (external attention). Comparing HEPs during omissions allowed for the observation of pure predictive signals, without contaminating auditory input. We observed an early effect of cardio-audio delay, reflecting a difference in heartbeat-driven expectations. We also observed a larger positivity to omissions of sounds perceived as synchronous than to omissions of sounds perceived as asynchronous when attending internally only, consistent with the role of attentional precision for enhancing predictions. These results provide support for attentionally-modulated cross-modal predictive coding, and suggest a potential tool for investigating its role in emotion and self-awareness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Actions are guided by a combination of external cues, internal intentions and stored knowledge. Self-initiated voluntary actions, produced without any immediate external cue, may be preceded by a slow EEG Readiness Potential (RP) that progressively increases prior to action. The cognitive significance of this neural event is controversial. Some accounts link the RP to the fact that timing of voluntary actions is generated endogenously, without external constraints, and perhaps even randomly. Other accounts take the RP as reflecting the unique role of planning, therefore of temporal expectation, in voluntary actions. In many previous experiments, actions are both unconstrained by external cues, but also potentially involve preplanning and anticipation. To separate these factors, we developed a reinforcement learning paradigm where participants learned, through trial and error, the optimal time to act. If the RP reflects freedom from external constraint, its amplitude should be greater early in learning, when participants do not yet know the best time to act. Conversely, if the RP reflects planning, it should be greater later on, when participants have learned, and know in advance, the time of action. We found that RP amplitudes grew with learning, suggesting that this neural activity reflects planning and anticipation for the forthcoming action, rather than freedom from external constraint.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Adaptive agents must act in intrinsically uncertain environments with complex latent structure. Here, we elaborate a model of visual foraging {\textendash} in a hierarchical context {\textendash} wherein agents infer a higher-order visual pattern (a {\textquoteleft}scene{\textquoteright}) by sequentially sampling ambiguous cues. Inspired by previous models of scene construction {\textendash} that cast perception and action as consequences of approximate Bayesian inference {\textendash} we use active inference to simulate decisions of agents categorizing a scene in a hierarchically-structured setting. Under active inference, agents develop probabilistic beliefs about their environment, while actively sampling it to maximise the evidence for their internal generative model. This approximate evidence maximization (i.e. self-evidencing) comprises drives to both maximise rewards and resolve uncertainty about hidden states. This is realised via minimization of a free energy functional of posterior beliefs about both the world as well as the actions used to sample or perturb it, corresponding to perception and action, respectively. We show that active inference, in the context of hierarchical scene construction, gives rise to many empirical evidence accumulation phenomena, such as noise-sensitive reaction times and epistemic saccades. We explain these behaviours in terms of the principled drives that constitute the expected free energy, the key quantity for evaluating policies under active inference. In addition, we report novel behaviours exhibited by these active inference agents that furnish new predictions for research on evidence accumulation and perceptual decision-making. We discuss the implications of this hierarchical active inference scheme for tasks that require planned sequences of information-gathering actions to infer compositional latent structure (such as visual scene construction and sentence comprehension). Finally, we propose experiments to contextualise active inference in relation to other formulations of evidence accumulation (e.g. drift-diffusion models) in tasks that require planning in uncertain environments with higher-order structure.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Using an auditory adaptive decision-making task, we show that evoked pupil diameter is more parsimoniously described as signaling violations of learned, top-down expectations than changes in low-level stimulus properties. We further show that both baseline and evoked pupil diameter is modulated by the degree to which individual subjects use these violations to update their subsequent expectations, as reflected in the complexity of their updating strategy. Together these results demonstrate a central role for idiosyncratic cognitive processing in how arousal systems respond to new inputs and, via our complexity-based analyses, provide a unified framework for understanding these effects in terms of both inference processes aimed to reduce belief uncertainty and more traditional notions of mental effort.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	doi = {10.1101/633677},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Within computational neuroscience, the algorithmic and neural basis of structure learning remains poorly understood. Concept learning is one primary example, which requires both a type of internal model expansion process (adding novel hidden states that explain new observations), and a model reduction process (merging different states into one underlying cause and thus reducing model complexity via meta-learning). Although various algorithmic models of concept learning have been proposed within machine learning and cognitive science, many are limited to various degrees by an inability to generalize, the need for very large amounts of training data, and/or insufficiently established biological plausibility. Using concept learning as an example case, we introduce a novel approach for modeling structure learning {\textendash} and specifically state-space expansion and reduction {\textendash} within the active inference framework and its accompanying neural process theory. Our aim is to demonstrate its potential to facilitate a novel line of active inference research in this area. The approach we lay out is based on the idea that a generative model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause) {\textquoteleft}slots{\textquoteright} that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction process, in which any concept learning {\textendash} associated with these slots {\textendash} can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model{\textquoteright}s ability to add new concepts to its state space (with relatively few observations) and increase the granularity of the concepts it currently possesses. We also simulate the predicted neural basis of these processes. We further show that it can accomplish a simple form of {\textquoteleft}one-shot{\textquoteright} generalization to new stimuli. Although deliberately simple, these simulation results highlight ways in which active inference could offer useful resources in developing neurocomputational models of structure learning. They provide a template for how future active inference research could apply this approach to real-world structure learning problems and assess the added utility it may offer.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Any mismatch between predicted and current input (prediction error) is then fed forward up the hierarchy leading to a revision of the prediction. We tested this hypothesis in the domain of object vision using a combination of multivariate pattern analysis and time-resolved electroencephalography. We presented participants with sequences of images that stepped around fixation in a predictable order. On the majority of presentations, the images conformed to a consistent pattern of position order and object category order, however, on a subset of presentations the last image in the sequence violated the established pattern by either violating the predicted category or position of the object. Contrary to classic predictive coding when decoding position and category we found no differences in decoding accuracy between predictable and violation conditions. However, consistent with recent extensions of predictive coding, exploratory analyses showed that a greater proportion of predictions was made to the forthcoming position in the sequence than to either the previous position or the position behind the previous position suggesting that the visual system actively anticipates future input as opposed to just inferring current input.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, the causal interactions in this uncertainty-encoding neurocircuitry and how these neural dynamics impact relapse remain elusive. Here, we used model-based fMRI to measure choice uncertainty in a motor decision task in 61 individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD) and 25 healthy controls. CUD participants were assessed before discharge from a residential treatment program and followed for up to 24 weeks. We found that choice uncertainty was tracked by the AIC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and ventral striatum (VS), across participants. Stronger activations in these regions measured pre-discharge predicted longer abstinence after discharge in individuals with CUD. Dynamic causal modelling revealed an AIC-to-dACC directed connectivity modulated by uncertainty in controls, but a dACC-to-AIC connectivity in CUD participants. This reversal was mostly driven by early-relapsers (\&lt;30 days). Furthermore, CUD individuals who displayed a stronger AIC-to-dACC excitatory connection during uncertainty encoding remained abstinent for longer periods. These findings reveal a critical role of an AIC-driven, uncertainty-encoding neurocircuitry in protecting against relapse and promoting abstinence.},

	abstract = {The predictive processing framework describes perception as a hierarchical predictive model of sensation. Higher-level neural structures constrain the processing at lower-level structures by suppressing synaptic activity induced by predictable sensory input. But when predictions fail, deviant input is forwarded bottom-up as {\textquoteleft}prediction error{\textquoteright} to update the perceptual model. The earliest prediction error signals identified in the auditory pathway emerge from the nonlemniscal inferior colliculus (IC). The drive that these feedback signals exert on the perceptual model depends on their {\textquoteleft}expected precision{\textquoteright}, which determines the postsynaptic gain applied in prediction error forwarding. Expected precision is theoretically encoded by the neuromodulatory (e.g., dopaminergic) systems. To test this empirically, we recorded extracellular responses from the rat nonlemniscal IC to oddball and cascade sequences before, during and after the microiontophoretic application of dopamine or eticlopride (a D2-like receptor antagonist). Hence, we studied dopaminergic modulation on the subcortical processing of unpredictable and predictable auditory changes. Results demonstrate that dopamine reduces the net neuronal responsiveness exclusively to unexpected input, without significantly altering the processing of expected auditory events at population level. We propose that, in natural conditions, dopaminergic projections from the thalamic subparafascicular nucleus to the nonlemniscal IC could serve as a precision-weighting mechanism mediated by D2-like receptors. Thereby, the levels of dopamine release in the nonlemniscal IC could modulate the early bottom-up flow of prediction error signals in the auditory system by encoding their expected precision.CAScascade condition.CSIcommon SSA index.dB SPLdecibels sound pressure level.DEVdeviant condition.FRfiring rate (spikes/s).FRAfrequency response area.ICinferior colliculus.iMMindex of neuronal mismatch.PEprediction error.SFRspontaneous firing rate (spikes/s).SPFsubparafascicular nucleus of the thalamus.SSAstimulus-specific adaptation.STDstandard condition.TDTTucker-Davis Technologies.},

We show that the variance of expected rewards, independently of the value of the rewards, was represented in single neuron and population spiking activity and local field potential (LFP) oscillations. Moreover, uncertainty asymmetrically affected the coherence between spikes and LFPs, selectively suppressing information transmission from the frontal to the parietal lobe but enhancing transmission from the parietal to the frontal lobe, consistent with Bayesian principles of optimal inference under uncertainty.},

The notion of active listening inherits from active inference, which considers perception and action under one universal imperative: to maximise the evidence for our (generative) models of the world. First, we describe a generative model of spoken words that simulates (i) how discrete lexical, prosodic, and speaker attributes give rise to continuous acoustic signals; and conversely (ii) how continuous acoustic signals are recognised as words. The {\textquoteleft}active{\textquoteright} aspect involves (covertly) segmenting spoken sentences and borrows ideas from active vision. It casts speech segmentation as the selection of internal actions, corresponding to the placement of word boundaries. Practically, word boundaries are selected that maximise the evidence for an internal model of how individual words are generated. We establish face validity by simulating speech recognition and showing how the inferred content of a sentence depends on prior beliefs and background noise. Finally, we consider predictive validity by associating neuronal or physiological responses, such as the mismatch negativity and P300, with belief updating under active listening, which is greatest in the absence of accurate prior beliefs about what will be heard next.},

Yet, recent experimental data showing the visual system{\textquoteright}s ability to localize faces in natural images within 100ms (Crouzet et al., 2010) challenge the prevalent hierarchical description of the visual system, and instead suggest the hypothesis of face-selectivity in early visual areas.

We found converging evidence for neural representations selective for upright faces in V1/V2, with latencies starting around 40 ms post-stimulus onset. Our findings suggest a revision of the standard {\textquotedblleft}simple-to-complex{\textquotedblright} model of hierarchical visual processing.Significance statement Visual processing in the brain is classically described as a series of stages with increasingly complex object representations: early visual areas encode simple visual features (such as oriented bars), and high-level visual areas encode representations for complex objects (such as faces). In the present study, we provide behavioral, fMRI, and EEG evidence for representations of complex objects {\textendash} namely faces {\textendash} in early visual areas. Our results challenge the standard {\textquotedblleft}simple-to-complex{\textquotedblright} model of visual processing, suggesting that it needs to be revised to include neural representations for faces at the lowest levels of the visual hierarchy.

Moreover, when contrasting {\textquotedblleft}own-high/other-low vs. own-low/other-high{\textquotedblright} incongruent trials, left anterior inferior parietal lobule (l-aIPL) was parametrically mapped, and the {\textquotedblleft}yield (e.g., own-high/not-buy) vs. insist (e.g., own-low/not-buy){\textquotedblright} modulation further revealed left lateral-IPL (l-lIPL), together with left TPJ forming a local social decision network that was further constrained by the mediation analysis among left TPJ-lIPL-aIPL. In sum, these results exemplify, via the two-person fMRI, the neural substrate of shopping interactions between couples.},

Recent behavioral work mapping emotional responses to 2185 videos found that people experience upwards of 27 distinct emotions occupying a high-dimensional space, and that emotion categories, more so than affective dimensions (e.g., valence), organize self-reports of subjective experience. Here, we sought to identify the neural substrates of this high-dimensional space of emotional experience using fMRI responses to all 2185 videos. Our analyses demonstrated that (1) dozens of video-evoked emotions were accurately predicted from fMRI patterns in multiple brain regions with different regional configurations for individual emotions, (2) emotion categories better predicted cortical and subcortical responses than affective dimensions, outperforming visual and semantic covariates in transmodal regions, and (3) emotion-related fMRI responses had a cluster-like organization efficiently characterized by distinct categories. These results support an emerging theory of the high-dimensional emotion space, illuminating its neural foundations distributed across transmodal regions.},

	abstract = {The development of vision during the first months of life is an active process that comprises the learning of appropriate neural representations and the learning of accurate eye movements. While it has long been suspected that the two learning processes are coupled, there is still no widely accepted theoretical framework describing this joint development. Here we propose a computational model of the development of active binocular vision to fill this gap. The model is based on a new formulation of the Active Efficient Coding theory, which proposes that eye movements, as well as stimulus encoding, are jointly adapted to maximize the overall coding efficiency. Under healthy conditions, the model self-calibrates to perform accurate vergence and accommodation eye movements. It exploits disparity cues to deduce the direction of defocus, which leads to co-ordinated vergence and accommodation responses. In a simulated anisometropic case, where the refraction power of the two eyes differs, an amblyopia-like state develops, in which the foveal region of one eye is suppressed due to inputs from the other eye. After correcting for refractive errors, the model can only reach healthy performance levels if receptive fields are still plastic, in line with findings on a critical period for binocular vision development. Overall, our model offers a unifying conceptual framework for understanding the development of binocular vision.Significance Statement Brains must operate in an energy-efficient manner. The efficient coding hypothesis states that sensory systems achieve this by adapting neural representations to the statistics of sensory input signals. Importantly, however, these statistics are shaped by the organism{\textquoteright}s behavior and how it samples information from the environment. Therefore, optimal performance requires jointly optimizing neural representations and behavior, a theory called Active Efficient Coding. Here we test the plausibility of this theory by proposing a computational model of the development of binocular vision. The model explains the development of accurate binocular vision under healthy conditions. In the case of refractive errors, however, the model develops an amblyopia-like state and suggests conditions for successful treatment.},

	abstract = {Paranoia is the belief that harm is intended by others. It may arise from selective pressures to infer and avoid social threats, particularly in ambiguous or changing circumstances. We propose that uncertainty may be sufficient to elicit learning differences in paranoid individuals, without social threat. We used reversal learning behaviour and computational modelling to estimate belief updating across individuals with and without mental illness, online participants, and rats exposed to chronic methamphetamine, an elicitor of paranoia in humans. Paranoia is associated with a strong but immutable prior on volatility, accompanied by elevated sensitivity to perceived changes in the task environment. Methamphetamine exposure in rats recapitulates this impaired uncertainty-driven belief updating and rigid anticipation of a volatile environment. Our work provides evidence of fundamental, domain-general learning differences in paranoid individuals. This paradigm enables further assessment of the interplay between uncertainty and belief-updating across individuals and species.},

A key research task is to understand how these two theories relate to one another, and particularly, how the brain transitions from a predictive early state to the eventual engagement of a brain-scale state (the global workspace). To address this question, we present a source-localisation of EEG responses evoked by the local-global task {\textendash} an experimental paradigm that engages a predictive hierarchy, which encompasses the global workspace. The results of our source reconstruction suggest three-phases of processing. The first phase involves the sensory (here auditory) regions of the superior temporal lobe and predicts sensory regularities over a short timeframe (as per the local effect). The third phase is brain-scale, involving inferior frontal, as well as inferior and superior parietal regions; consistent with a global neuronal workspace (as per the global effect). Crucially, our analysis suggests that there is an intermediate (second) phase, involving modulatory interactions between inferior frontal and superior temporal regions. Furthermore, sedation with propofol reduces modulatory interactions in the second phase. This selective effect is consistent with a predictive coding explanation of sedation, with propofol acting on descending predictions of the precision of prediction errors; thereby constraining access to the global neuronal workspace.},

	abstract = {Neural responses to auditory surprise are typically studied with highly unexpected, disruptive sounds. Consequently, little is known about auditory prediction in everyday contexts that are characterized by fine-grained, non-disruptive fluctuations of auditory surprise. To address this issue, we used IDyOM, a computational model of auditory expectation, to obtain continuous surprise estimates for a set of newly composed melodies. Our main goal was to assess whether the neural correlates of non-disruptive surprising sounds in a musical context are affected by musical expertise. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), auditory responses were recorded from musicians and non-musicians while they listened to the melodies. Consistent with a previous study, the amplitude of the N1m component increased with higher levels of computationally estimated surprise. This effect, however, was not different between the two groups. Further analyses offered an explanation for this finding: Pitch interval size itself, rather than probabilistic prediction, was responsible for the modulation of the N1m, thus pointing to low-level sensory adaptation as the underlying mechanism. In turn, the formation of auditory regularities and proper probabilistic prediction were reflected in later components: the mismatch negativity (MMNm) and the P3am, respectively. Overall, our findings reveal a hierarchy of expectations in the auditory system and highlight the need to properly account for sensory adaptation in research addressing statistical learning.Highlights- In melodies, sound expectedness (modeled with IDyOM) is associated with the amplitude of the N1m.- This effect is not different between musicians and non-musicians.- Sensory adaptation related to melodic pitch intervals explains better the N1m effect.- Auditory regularities and the expectations captured by IDyOM are reflected in the MMNm and P3am.- Evidence for a hierarchy of auditory predictions during melodic listening.AICAkaike information criterionBEMBoundary element methodBFBayes FactorERFEvent related fieldF0Fundamental frequencyGMSIGoldsmiths Musical Sophistication IndexICInformation contentIDyOMInformation Dynamics of MusicMAMean amplitudeMETMusical ear testMNIMontreal Neurological InstituteSSAStimulus specific adaptationWAICWidely applicable information criterion},

This difference between the groups was driven by increased amplitudes to self-produced phonemes, and reduced amplitudes passively heard phonemes in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease.Conclusions The finding indicates that auditory evoked activity is abnormally modulated during speech in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s patients who do not subjectively notice speech impairment. This mechanism could play a role in producing speech deficits in as the disease progresses.},

	abstract = {Animal behavior constantly adapts to changes, for example when the statistical properties of the environment change unexpectedly. For an agent that interacts with this volatile setting, it is important to react accurately and as quickly as possible. It has already been shown that when a random sequence of motion ramps of a visual target is biased to one direction (e.g. right or left), human observers adapt their eye movements to accurately anticipate the target{\textquoteright}s expected direction. Here, we prove that this ability extends to a volatile environment where the probability bias could change at random switching times. In addition, we also recorded the explicit prediction of the next outcome as reported by observers using a rating scale. Both results were compared to the estimates of a probabilistic agent that is optimal in relation to the assumed generative model. Compared to the classical leaky integrator model, we found a better match between our probabilistic agent and the behavioral responses, both for the anticipatory eye movements and the explicit task. Furthermore, by controlling the level of preference between exploitation and exploration in the model, we were able to fit for each individual{\textquoteright}s experimental dataset the most likely level of volatility and analyze inter-individual variability across participants. These results prove that in such an unstable environment, human observers can still represent an internal belief about the environmental contingencies, and use this representation both for sensory-motor control and for explicit judgments. This work offers an innovative approach to more generically test the diversity of human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.Author summary Understanding how humans adapt to changing environments to make judgments or plan motor responses based on time-varying sensory information is crucial for psychology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Current theories for how we deal with the environment{\textquoteright}s uncertainty, that is, in response to the introduction of some randomness change, mostly rely on the behavior at equilibrium, long after after a change. Here, we show that in the more ecological case where the context switches at random times all along the experiment, an adaptation to this volatility can be performed online. In particular, we show in two behavioral experiments that humans can adapt to such volatility at the early sensorimotor level, through their anticipatory eye movements, but also at a higher cognitive level, through explicit ratings. Our results suggest that humans (and future artificial systems) can use much richer adaptive strategies than previously assumed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, it is usually difficult to elucidate whether the observed dynamic connectivity is functionally meaningful or simply due to noise during unconstrained task conditions such as resting-state. During naturalistic conditions, such as watching a movie, it has been shown that local brain activities, e.g. in the visual cortex, are consistent across subjects. Following similar logic, we propose to study intersubject correlations of the time courses of dynamic connectivity during naturalistic conditions to extract functionally meaningful dynamic connectivity patterns. We analyzed a functional MRI (fMRI) dataset when the subjects watched a short animated movie. We calculated dynamic connectivity by using sliding window technique, and quantified the intersubject correlations of the time courses of dynamic connectivity. Although the time courses of dynamic connectivity are thought to be noisier than the original signals, we found similar level of intersubject correlations of dynamic connectivity to those of regional activity. Most importantly, highly consistent dynamic connectivity could occur between regions that did not show high intersubject correlations of regional activity, and between regions with little stable functional connectivity. The analysis highlighted higher order brain regions such as the default mode network that dynamically interacted with posterior visual regions during the movie watching, which may be associated with the understanding of the movie.HighlightsIntersubject consistency may provide a complementary approach to study brain dynamic connectivityWidespread brain regions showed highly consistent dynamic connectivity during movie watching, while these regions themselves did not show highly consistent regional activityConsistent dynamic connectivity often occurred between regions from different functional systems},

We rigorously tested this hypothesis using multiple experiments and multiple computational models. We obtained strong evidence that people deviated from the objectively rational strategy when potential losses were large. They instead appeared to follow a strategy in which they simplify the decision problem and satisfice rather than optimize. This work is consistent with the framework known as bounded rationality, according to which people behave rationally given their computational limitations.},

	abstract = {Reciprocated trust plays a critical role in forming and maintaining relationships, and has consistently been shown to implicate neural circuits involved in reward-related processing and social cognition. Less is known about neural network connectivity during social interactions involving trust, however, particularly as a function of closeness between an investor and a trustee. We examined network reactivity and connectivity in participants who played an economic trust game with close friends, strangers and a computer. Network reactivity analyses showed enhanced activation of the DMN to social relative to non-social outcomes. A novel network psychophysiological interaction analysis (nPPI) revealed enhanced connectivity between the DMN and the superior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule when experiencing reciprocated vs. violated trust from friends relative to strangers. Such connectivity tracked with differences in self-reported social closeness with these partners. Interestingly, reactivity of the executive control network (ECN), involved in decision processes, demonstrated no social vs. non-social preference, and ECN-ventral striatum (VS) connectivity did not track social closeness. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that DMN interacts with components of attention and control networks to signal the relative importance of positive experiences with close others vs. strangers.},

	abstract = {The brain is constantly anticipating the future of sensory inputs based on past experiences. When new sensory data is different from predictions shaped by recent trends, neural signals are generated to report this surprise. Existing models for quantifying surprise are based on an ideal observer assumption operating under one of the three definitions of surprise set forth as the Shannon, Bayesian, and Confidence-corrected surprise. In this paper, we analyze both visual and auditory EEG and auditory MEG signals recorded during oddball tasks to examine which temporal components in these signals are sufficient to decode the brain{\textquoteright}s surprise based on each of these three definitions. We found that for both recording systems the Shannon surprise is always significantly better decoded than the Bayesian surprise regardless of the sensory modality and the selected temporal features used for decoding.Author summary A regression model is proposed for decoding the level of the brain{\textquoteright}s surprise in response to sensory sequences using selected temporal components of recorded EEG and MEG data. Three surprise quantification definitions (Shannon, Bayesian, and Confidence-corrected surprise) are compared in offering decoding power. Four different regimes for selecting temporal samples of EEG and MEG data are used to evaluate which part of the recorded data may contain signatures that represent the brain{\textquoteright}s surprise in terms of offering a high decoding power. We found that both the middle and late components of the EEG response offer strong decoding power for surprise while the early components are significantly weaker in decoding surprise. In the MEG response, we found that the middle components have the highest decoding power while the late components offer moderate decoding powers. When using a single temporal sample for decoding surprise, samples of the middle segment possess the highest decoding power. Shannon surprise is always better decoded than the other definitions of surprise for all the four temporal feature selection regimes. Similar superiority for Shannon surprise is observed for the EEG and MEG data across the entire range of temporal sample regimes used in our analysis.},

To understand the principles underlying such belief updates, we need tools to uncover subjects{\textquoteright} belief dynamics from natural behaviour. We tested whether eye movements could be used to infer subjects{\textquoteright} beliefs about latent variables using a naturalistic, visuomotor navigation task. We observed eye movements that appeared to continuously track the goal location even when no visible target was present there. Accurate goal-tracking was associated with improved task performance, and inhibiting eye movements in humans impaired navigation precision. By using passive stimulus playback and manipulating stimulus reliability, we show that subjects{\textquoteright} eye movements are likely voluntary, rather than reflexive. These results suggest that gaze dynamics play a key role in action-selection during challenging visuomotor behaviours, and may possibly serve as a window into the subject{\textquoteright}s dynamically evolving internal beliefs.},

	abstract = {Research on how humans perceive sensory inputs from their bodies ({\textquoteleft}interoception{\textquoteright}) has been rapidly gaining momentum, with interest across a host of disciplines from physiology through to psychiatry. However, studying interoceptive processes is not without significant challenges, and many methods utilised to access internal states have been largely devoted to capturing and relating naturally-occurring variations in interoceptive signals (such as heartbeats) to measures of how the brain processes these signals. An alternative procedure involves the controlled perturbation of specific interoceptive axes. This is challenging because it requires non-invasive interventions that can be repeated many times within a subject and that are potent but safe. Here we present an effective methodology for instigating these perturbations within the breathing domain. We describe a custom-built circuitry that is capable of delivering inspiratory resistive loads automatically and precisely. Importantly, our approach is compatible with magnetic resonance imaging environments, allowing for the administration of complicated experimental designs in neuroimaging as increasingly required within developing fields such as computational psychiatry/psychosomatics. We describe the experimental setup for both the control and monitoring of the inspiratory resistive loads, and demonstrate its possible utilities within different study designs. This methodology represents an important step forward from the previously utilised, manually-controlled resistive loading setups, which present significant experimental burdens with prolonged and/or complicated sequences of breathing stimuli.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized partly by atypical attentional engagement, such as hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli. Attentional engagement is known to be regulated by the locus coeruleus (LC). Moderate baseline LC activity globally dampens neural responsivity and is associated with adaptive deployment and narrowing of attention to task-relevant stimuli. In contrast, increased baseline LC activity enhances neural responsivity across cortex and widening of attention to environmental stimuli regardless of their task relevance. Given attentional atypicalities in ASD, this study is the first to evaluate whether individuals with ASD exhibit a different profile of LC activity compared to typically developing controls under different attentional task demands. Males and females with ASD and age- and gender-matched controls participated in a one-back letter detection test while task-evoked pupillary responses{\textemdash}an established inverse correlate for baseline LC activity{\textemdash}were recorded. Participants completed this task in two conditions, either in the absence or presence of distractor auditory tones. Compared to controls, individuals with ASD evinced atypical pupillary responses in the presence versus absence of distractors. Notably, this atypical pupillary profile was evident despite the fact that both groups exhibited equivalent task performance. Moreover, between-group differences in pupillary responses were observed only in response to task-relevant and not to task-irrelevant stimuli, providing confirmation that the group differences are specifically associated with distinctions in LC activity. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD show atypical modulation of LC activity with changes in attentional demands, offering a possible mechanistic and neurobiological account for attentional atypicalities in ASD.Significance Statement Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit atypical attentional behaviors, such as environmental hypersensitivity and atypical fixedness, but the neural mechanism underlying these behaviors remains elusive. One candidate mechanism is atypical locus coeruleus (LC) activity, as the LC has a critical role in attentional modulation. Elevated LC activity is associated with environmental exploration, while moderate LC activity is associated with focused attention on relevant stimuli. This study shows that, under tightly controlled conditions, task-evoked pupil responses{\textemdash}an LC activity proxy{\textemdash}are lower in individuals with ASD than in controls, but only in the presence of task-irrelevant stimuli. This suggests that individuals with ASD evince atypical modulation of LC activity in accordance with changes in attentional demands, offering a mechanistic account for attentional atypicalities in ASD.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies is revealing an unexpectedly large degree of heterogeneity in gene expression levels across the different cells that compose the same tissue sample. However, little is known on the functional consequences of this heterogeneity and the contribution of individual cell-fate decisions to the collective behavior of the tissues these cells are part of. Mechanistic models of signaling pathways have already proven to be useful tools for understanding relevant aspects of cell functionality. Here we propose to use this mechanistic modeling strategy to deconvolute the complexity of the functional behavior of a tissue by dissecting it into the individual functional landscapes of its component cells by using a single-cell RNA-seq experiment of glioblastoma cells. This mechanistic modeling analysis revealed a high degree of heterogeneity at the scale of signaling circuits, suggesting the existence of a complex functional landscape at single cell level. Different clusters of neoplastic glioblastoma cells have been characterized according to their differences in signaling circuit activity profiles, which only partly overlap with the conventional glioblastoma subtype classification. The activity of signaling circuits that trigger cell functionalities which can easily be assimilated to cancer hallmarks reveals different functional strategies with different degrees of aggressiveness followed by any of the clusters.In addition, mechanistic modeling allows simulating the effect of interventions on the components of the signaling circuits, such as drug inhibitions. Thus, effects of drug inhibitions at single cell level can be dissected, revealing for the first time the mechanisms that individual cells use to avoid the effect of a targeted therapy which explain why and how a small proportion of cells display, in fact, different degrees of resistance to the treatment. The results presented here strongly suggest that mechanistic modeling at single cell level not only allows uncovering the molecular mechanisms of the tumor progression but also can predict the success of a treatment and can contribute to a better definition of therapeutic targets in the future.},

	abstract = {Background Antidepressant medication adherence is among the most important problems in health care worldwide. Interventions designed to increase adherence have largely failed, pointing towards a critical need to better understand the underlying decision-making processes that contribute to adherence. A computational decision-making model that integrates empirical data with a fundamental action selection principle could be pragmatically useful in 1) making individual level predictions about adherence, and 2) providing an explanatory framework that improves our understanding of non-adherence.Methods Here we formulate a partially observable Markov decision process model based on the active inference framework that can simulate several processes that plausibly influence adherence decisions.Results Using model simulations of the day-to-day decisions to take a prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), we show that several distinct parameters in the model can influence adherence decisions in predictable ways. These parameters include differences in policy depth (i.e., how far into the future one considers when deciding), decision uncertainty, beliefs about the predictability (stochasticity) of symptoms, beliefs about the magnitude and time course of symptom reductions and side effects, and the strength of medication-taking habits that one has acquired.Conclusions Clarifying these influential factors will be an important first step toward empirically determining which are contributing to non-adherence to antidepressants in individual patients. The model can also be seamlessly extended to simulate adherence to other medications (by incorporating the known symptom reduction and side effect trajectories of those medications), with the potential promise of identifying which medications may be best suited for different patients.},

This asymmetry suggests that higher-order cognitive and neural processes may be required for confidence in detection, and more specifically, in judgments about absence. In a within-subject, pre-registered and performance-matched fMRI design, we observed quadratic confidence effects in frontopolar cortex for detection but not discrimination. Furthermore, in the right temporoparietal junction, confidence effects were enhanced for judgments of target absence compared to judgments of target presence. We interpret these findings as reflecting qualitative differences between the neural basis of metacognitive evaluation of detection and discrimination, potentially in line with counterfactual or higher-order models of confidence formation in detection.},

	abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that perception and reasoning vary according to the phase of internal bodily signals such as heartbeat. This has been shown by locking the presentation of sensory events to distinct phases of the cardiac cycle. However, task-relevant information is not usually encountered in such a phase-locked manner nor passively accessed, but rather actively sampled at one{\textquoteright}s own pace. Moreover, if the phase of the cardiac cycle is an important modulator of perception and cognition, as previously proposed, then the way in which we actively sample the world should be similarly modulated by the phase of the cardiac cycle. Here we tested this by coregistration of eye movements and heartbeat signals while participants freely compared differences between two visual arrays. Across three different analyses, we found a significant coupling of saccades, subsequent fixations, and blinks with the cardiac cycle. More eye movements were generated during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, which has been reported as the period of maximal effect of the baroreceptors{\textquoteright} activity upon cognition. Conversely, more fixations were found during the diastole phase (quiescent baroreceptors). Lastly, more blinks were generated in the later period of the cardiac cycle. These results suggest that interoceptive and exteroceptive processing do adjust to each other; in our case, by sampling the outer environment during quiescent periods of the inner organism.},

	abstract = {Learning of complex auditory sequences such as language and music can be thought of as the continuous optimisation of internal predictive representations of sound-pattern regularities, driven by prediction errors. In predictive coding (PC), this occurs through changes in the intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity of the relevant cortical networks, whereby minimization of precision-weighted prediction error signals improves the accuracy of future predictions. Here, we employed Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) on functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data acquired during the presentation of complex auditory patterns. In an oddball paradigm, we presented 52 volunteers (non-musicians) with isochronous 5-tone melodic patterns (standards), randomly interleaved with rare novel patterns comprising contour or pitch interval changes (deviants). Here, listeners must update their standard melodic models whenever they encounter unexpected deviant stimuli. Contour deviants induced an increased BOLD response, as compared to standards, in primary (Heschl{\textquoteright}s gyrus, HG) and secondary auditory cortices (planum temporale, PT). Within this network, we found a left-lateralized increase in feedforward connectivity from HG to PT for deviant responses and a concomitant disinhibition within left HG. Consistent with PC, our results suggest that model updating in auditory pattern perception and learning is associated with specific changes in the excitatory feedforward connections encoding prediction errors and in the intrinsic connections that encode the precision of these errors and modulate their gain.Significance statement The learning of complex auditory stimuli such as music and speech can be thought of as the continuous optimisation of brain predictive models driven by prediction errors. Using dynamic causal modelling on fMRI data acquired during a melodic oddball paradigm, we here show that brain responses to unexpected sounds were best explained by an increase in excitation within Heschl{\textquoteright}s gyrus and an increase in forward connections from Heschl{\textquoteright}s gyrus to planum temporale. Our results are consistent with a predictive coding account of sensory learning, whereby prediction error responses to new sounds drive model adjustments via feedforward connections and intrinsic connections encode the confidence of these prediction errors.},

	abstract = {Cognitive control is typically understood as a set of mechanisms which enable humans to reach goals that require integrating the consequences of actions over longer time scales. Importantly, using routine beheavior or making choices beneficial only at a short time scales would prevent one from attaining these goals. During the past two decades, researchers have proposed various computational cognitive models that successfully account for behaviour related to cognitive control in a wide range of laboratory tasks. As humans operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, making elaborate plans and integrating experience over multiple time scales is computationally expensive, the specific question of how uncertain consequences at different time scales are integrated into adaptive decisions remains poorly understood. Here, we propose that precisely the problem of integrating experience and forming elaborate plans over multiple time scales is a key component for better understanding how human agents solve cognitive control dilemmas such as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. In support of this conjecture, we present a computational model of probabilistic inference over hidden states and actions, which are represented as a hierarchy of time scales. Simulations of goal-reaching agents instantiating the model in an uncertain and dynamic task environment show how the exploration-exploitation dilemma may be solved by inferring meta-control states which adapt behaviour to changing contexts.},

	abstract = {Animals often navigate environments that are uncertain, volatile and complex, making it challenging to locate reliable food sources. Therefore, it is not surprising that many species evolved multiple, parallel and complementary foraging strategies to survive. Current research on animal behavior is largely driven by a reductionist approach and attempts to study one particular aspect of behavior in isolation. This is justified by the huge success of past and current research in understanding neural circuit mechanisms of behaviors. But focusing on only one aspect of behaviors obscures their inherent multidimensional nature. To fill this gap we aimed to identify and characterize distinct behavioral modules using a simple reward foraging assay. For this we developed a single-animal, trial-based probabilistic foraging task, where freely walking fruit flies experience optogenetic sugar-receptor neuron stimulation. By carefully analyzing the walking trajectories of flies, we were able to dissect the animals foraging decisions into multiple underlying systems. We show that flies perform local searches, cue-based navigation and learn task relevant contingencies. Using probabilistic reward delivery allowed us to bid several competing reinforcement learning (RL) models against each other. We discover that flies accumulate chosen option values, forget unchosen option values and seek novelty. We further show that distinct behavioral modules -learning and navigation-based systems-cooperate, suggesting that reinforcement learning in flies operates on dimensionality reduced representations. We therefore argue that animals will apply combinations of multiple behavioral strategies to generate foraging decisions.},

	abstract = {Most rewards in our lives require effort to obtain them. It is known that effort is seen by humans as carrying an intrinsic disutility which devalues the obtainable reward. Established models for effort discounting account for this by using participant-specific discounting parameters inferred from experiments. These parameters offer only a static glance into the bigger picture of effort exertion. The mechanism underlying the dynamic changes in a participant{\textquoteright}s willingness to exert effort is still unclear and an active topic of research. Here, we modeled dynamic effort exertion as a consequence of effort- and probability-discounting mechanisms during goal reaching, sequential behavior. To do this, we developed a novel sequential decision-making task in which participants make binary choices to reach a minimum number of points. Importantly, the time points and circumstances of effort allocation are decided by participants according to their own preferences and not imposed directly by the task. Using the computational model to analyze participants{\textquoteright} choices, we show that the dynamics of effort exertion arise from a combination of changing task needs and forward planning. In other words, the interplay between a participant{\textquoteright}s inferred discounting parameters is sufficient to explain the dynamic allocation of effort during goal reaching. Using formal model comparison, we also infer the forward-planning strategy used by participants. The model allows us to characterize a participant{\textquoteright}s effort exertion in terms of only a few parameters. Moreover, the model can be adapted to a number of tasks used in establishing the neural underpinnings of forward-planning behavior and meta-control, allowing for the characterization of behavior in terms of model parameters.},

Across groups, glutamate concentration in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was associated with higher and lower inhibitory connectivity in the dACC and in the anterior insula (AI) respectively. Crucially, glutamate concentration correlated negatively with the inhibitory influence on the excitatory neuronal population in the dACC of FEP subjects. Furthermore, aberrant computational parameters of the cognitive-control task performance were associated with aberrant inhibitory connections. Finally, the strength of connections from the dACC to the AI correlated negatively with severity of social withdrawal. These findings support a link between glutamate-mediated cortical disinhibition, deficits in effective connectivity, and computational performance in psychosis.},

	abstract = {Recognising speech in background noise is a strenuous daily activity, yet most humans can master it. A mechanistic explanation of how the human brain deals with such sensory uncertainty is the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis. In this view, the brain uses a dynamic generative model to simulate the most likely trajectory of the speech signal. Such simulation account can explain why there is a task-dependent modulation of sensory pathway structures (i.e., the sensory thalami) for recognition tasks that require tracking of fast-varying stimulus properties (i.e., speech) in contrast to relatively constant stimulus properties (e.g., speaker identity) despite the same stimulus input. Here we test the specific hypothesis that this task-dependent modulation for speech recognition increases in parallel with the sensory uncertainty in the speech signal. In accordance with this hypothesis, we show{\textemdash}by using ultra-high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants{\textemdash}that the task-dependent modulation of the left primary sensory thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body, vMGB) for speech is particularly strong when recognizing speech in noisy listening conditions in contrast to situations where the speech signal is clear. Exploratory analyses showed that this finding was specific to the left vMGB; it was not present in the midbrain structure of the auditory pathway (left inferior colliculus, IC). The results imply that speech in noise recognition is supported by modifications at the level of the subcortical sensory pathway providing driving input to the auditory cortex.},

We show that such cost functions can be cast as a variational bound on model evidence under an implicit generative model. Using generative models based on Markov decision processes (MDP), we show, analytically, that neural activity and plasticity perform Bayesian inference and learning, respectively, by maximising model evidence. Using mathematical and numerical analyses, we then confirm that biologically plausible cost functions{\textemdash}used in neural networks{\textemdash}correspond to variational free energy under some prior beliefs about the prevalence of latent states that generate inputs. These prior beliefs are determined by particular constants (i.e., thresholds) that define the cost function. This means that the Bayes optimal encoding of latent or hidden states is achieved when, and only when, the network{\textquoteright}s implicit priors match the process that generates the inputs. Our results suggest that when a neural network minimises its cost function, it is implicitly minimising variational free energy under optimal or sub-optimal prior beliefs. This insight is potentially important because it suggests that any free parameter of a neural network{\textquoteright}s cost function can itself be optimised{\textemdash}by minimisation with respect to variational free energy.},

Pupil dilation was greater for liked melodies, particularly when predictable. Motor performance was facilitated in predictable more than unpredictable melodies, but liked melodies were learned even in the unpredictable condition. Low-liked melodies also showed learning but mostly in participants with higher scores of task perceived competence. Taken together, these results suggest that effects of predictability on learning can be overshadowed by effects of stimulus liking or task-related intrinsic motivation.},

	abstract = {Previous research established that clinical anxiety impairs decision making and that high trait anxiety interferes with learning rates. Less understood are the effects of temporary anxious states on learning and decision making in healthy populations. Here we follow proposals that anxious states in healthy individuals elicit a pattern of aberrant behavioural, neural, and physiological responses comparable with those found in anxiety disorders, particularly when processing uncertainty in unstable environments. In our study, both a state anxious and a control group learned probabilistic stimulus-outcome mappings in a volatile task environment while we recorded their electrophysiological (EEG) signals. By using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we assessed the effect of state anxiety on Bayesian belief updating with a focus on uncertainty estimates. State anxiety was associated with an underestimation of environmental and informational uncertainty, and an increase in uncertainty about volatility estimates. Anxious individuals deemed their beliefs about reward contingencies to be more precise and to require less updating, ultimately leading to impaired reward-based learning. We interpret this pattern as evidence that state anxious individuals are less tolerant to informational uncertainty about the contingencies governing their environment and more uncertain about the level of stability of the world itself. Further, we tracked the neural representation of belief update signals in the trial-by-trial EEG amplitudes. In control participants, both lower-level precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) about the reward outcomes and higher-level volatility-pwPEs were represented in the ERP signals with an anterior distribution. A different pattern emerged under state anxiety, where a neural representation of pwPEs was only found for updates about volatility. Expanding previous computational work on trait anxiety, our findings establish that temporary anxious states in healthy individuals impair reward-based learning in volatile environments, primarily through changes in uncertainty estimates and potentially a degradation of the neuronal representation of hierarchically-related pwPEs, considered to play a central role in current Bayesian accounts of perceptual inference and learning.},

Action selection is initiated before regional visual decisions are completed. By linking behavior and physiology through theoretical decision models, we identify simultaneous forward and backward flow of information for visuomotor decisions between sensory and motor regions, in beta and gamma ranges.

Dynamic causal models of effective connectivity were focused on prefrontal and parietal cortex, where we examined parietal-prefrontal connectivity in relation to delusions in patients.

We then leveraged support vector regression models to define optimal normalized target connectivity tailored for each patient, and tested the extent to which deviation from this target predicted individual variation in delusion severity.Results In schizophrenia patients, updating and manipulating context information was disproportionately less accurate than was WM maintenance, with a task accuracy-by-diagnosis interaction.

	abstract = {Decision making relies on adequately evaluating the consequences of actions on the basis of past experience and the current physiological state. A key role in this process is played by the basal ganglia, where neural activity and plasticity are modulated by dopaminergic input from the midbrain. Internal physiological factors, such as hunger, scale signals encoded by dopaminergic neurons and thus they alter the motivation for taking actions and learning. However, to our knowledge, no formal mathematical formulation exists for how a physiological state affects learning and action selection in the basal ganglia. We developed a framework for modelling the effect of motivation on choice and learning. The framework defines the motivation to obtain a particular resource as the difference between the desired and the current level of this resource, and proposes how the utility of reinforcements depends on the motivation. To account for dopaminergic activity previously recorded at different physiological states, the paper argues that the prediction error encoded in the dopaminergic activity needs to be redefined as the difference between utility and expected utility, which depends on both the objective reinforcement and the motivation. We also demonstrate a possible mechanism by which the evaluation and learning of utility of actions can be implemented in the basal ganglia network. The presented theory brings together models of learning in the basal ganglia with the incentive salience theory in a single simple framework, and it provides a mechanistic insight into how decision processes and learning in the basal ganglia are modulated by the motivation. Moreover, this theory is also consistent with data on neural underpinnings of overeating and obesity, and makes further experimental predictions.Author summary Behaviour is made of decisions that are based on the evaluation of costs and benefits of potential actions in a given situation. Actions are usually generated in response to reinforcement cues which are potent triggers of desires that can range from normal appetites to compulsive addictions. However, learned cues are not constant in their motivating power. Food cues are more potent when you are hungry than when you have just finished a meal. These changes in cue-triggered desire produced by a change in biological state present a challenge to many current computational models of motivation and learning. Here, we demonstrate concrete examples of how motivation can instantly modulate reinforcement values and actions; we propose an overarching framework of learning and action selection based on maintaining the physiological balance to better capture the dynamic interaction between learning and physiology that controls the incentive salience mechanism of motivation for reinforcements. These models provide a unified account of state-dependent learning of the incentive value of actions and selecting actions according to the learned positive and negative consequences of those actions and with respect to the physiological state. We propose a biological implementation of how these processes are controlled by an area in the brain called the basal ganglia, which is associated with error-driven learning.},

	abstract = {Disturbance forces facilitate motor learning, but theoretical explanations for this counterintuitive phenomenon are lacking. Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such {\textquoteleft}active inference{\textquoteright} is driven by {\textquoteleft}surprise{\textquoteright}. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance helps learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning). Our findings reconcile research on the relationship between noise, variability, and motor learning, and show that information is the currency of motor learning.},

The organising principle in M1 does not follow an anatomical body map, but rather a distributed representational structure in which motor primitives are combined to produce motor outputs. Both electrophysiological recordings in primates and human imaging data suggest that M1 encodes kinematic features of movements, such as joint position and velocity. However, M1 exhibits well-documented sensory responses to cutaneous and proprioceptive stimuli, raising questions regarding the origins of kinematic motor representations: are they relevant in top-down motor control, or are they an epiphenomenon of bottom-up sensory feedback during movement? Moreover, to what extent is information related to muscle activity encoded in motor cortex? Here we provide evidence for spatially and temporally distinct encoding of kinematic and muscle information in human M1 during the production of a wide variety of naturalistic hand movements. Using a powerful combination of high-field fMRI and MEG, a spatial and temporal multivariate representational similarity analysis revealed encoding of kinematic information from data glove recordings in more caudal regions of M1, over 200ms before movement onset. In contrast, patterns of muscle activity from EMG were encoded in more rostral motor regions later in the cycle of movement. Our spatial and temporal analysis provide compelling evidence that top-down control of dexterous movement engages kinematic representations in caudal regions of M1 prior to movement production; an area with direct cortico-motorneuronal connections. Muscle information encoded more rostrally in M1 was engaged later, suggestive of involvement in bottom-up signalling.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic models of cognition typically assume that agents make inferences about current states by combining new sensory information with fixed beliefs about the past, an approach known as Bayesian filtering. This is computationally parsimonious, but, in general, leads to suboptimal beliefs about past states, since it ignores the fact that new observations typically contain information about the past as well as the present. This is disadvantageous both because knowledge of past states may be intrinsically valuable, and because it impairs learning about fixed or slowly changing parameters of the environment. For these reasons, in offline data analysis it is usual to infer on every set of states using the entire time series of observations, an approach known as (fixed-interval) Bayesian smoothing. Unfortunately, however, this is impractical for real agents, since it requires the maintenance and updating of beliefs about an ever-growing set of states. We propose an intermediate approach, finite retrospective inference (FRI), in which agents perform update beliefs about a limited number of past states. (Formally, this represents online fixed-lag smoothing with a sliding window.) This can be seen as a form of bounded rationality in which agents seek to optimise the accuracy of their beliefs subject to computational and other resource costs. We show through simulation that this approach has the capacity to significantly increase the accuracy of both inference and learning, using a simple variational scheme applied to both randomly generated Hidden Markov models (HMMs), and a specific application of the HMM, in the form of the widely used probabilistic reversal task. Our proposal thus constitutes a theoretical contribution to normative accounts of bounded rationality, which makes testable empirical predictions that can be explored in future work.},

To meet this important challenge, we develop and demonstrate here an approach called Translatable Components Regression (TransComp-R) to overcome inter-species and trans-omic discrepancies between CD mouse models and human subjects. TransComp-R combines CD mouse model proteomic data with patient pre-treatment transcriptomic data to identify molecular features discernable in the mouse data predictive of patient response to anti-TNF therapy. Interrogating the TransComp-R models predominantly revealed upregulated integrin pathway signaling via collagen-binding integrin ITGA1 in anti-TNF resistant colonic CD (cCD) patients. Toward validation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on biopsies from a cCD patient and analyzed publicly available immune cell proteomics data to characterize the immune and intestinal cell types contributing to anti-TNF resistance. We found that ITGA1 is indeed expressed in colonic T-cell populations and that interactions between collagen-binding integrins on T-cells and colonic cell types expressing secreted collagens are associated with anti-TNF therapy resistance. Biologically, TransComp-R linked previously disparate observations about collagen and ITGA1 signaling to a potential therapeutic avenue for overcoming anti-TNF therapy resistance in cCD. Methodologically, TransComp-R provides a flexible, generalizable framework for addressing inter-species, inter-omic, and inter-phenotypic discrepancies between animal models and patients to deliver translationally relevant biological insights.One Sentence Summary Brubaker et al. implicate dysregulated collagen-binding integrin signaling in resistance to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn{\textquoteright}s Disease by developing a mouse-proteomic to human-transcriptomic translation model and confirm the associated inter-cellular signaling network using single-cell RNA sequencing.},

	abstract = {How is semantic information stored in the human mind and brain? Some philosophers and cognitive scientists argue for vectorial representations of concepts, where the meaning of a word is represented as its position in a high-dimensional neural state space. At the intersection of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, a class of very successful distributional word vector models has developed that can account for classic EEG findings of language, i.e., the ease vs. difficulty of integrating a word with its sentence context. However, models of semantics have to account not only for context-based word processing, but should also describe how word meaning is represented. Here, we investigate whether distributional vector representations of word meaning can model brain activity induced by words presented without context. Using EEG activity (event-related brain potentials) collected while participants in two experiments (English, German) read isolated words, we encode and decode word vectors taken from the family of prediction-based word2vec algorithms. We find that, first, the position of a word in vector space allows the prediction of the pattern of corresponding neural activity over time, in particular during a time window of 300 to 500 ms after word onset. Second, distributional models perform better than a human-created taxonomic baseline model (WordNet), and this holds for several distinct vector-based models. Third, multiple latent semantic dimensions of word meaning can be decoded from brain activity. Combined, these results suggest that empiricist, prediction-based vectorial representations of meaning are a viable candidate for the representational architecture of human semantic knowledge.},

	abstract = {Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease may modulate chronometric and instrumental aspects of choice behaviour, including motor inhibition, decisional slowing, and value sensitivity. However, it is not well known whether STN-DBS affects more complex aspects of decision-making, such as the influence of subjective estimates of uncertainty on choices. In this study, thirty-eight participants with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease played a virtual casino prior to subthalamic DBS (whilst {\textquoteleft}on{\textquoteright} medication) and again, three-months postoperatively (whilst {\textquoteleft}on{\textquoteright} stimulation). At the group level, there was a small but statistically significant postoperative decrease in impulsivity, as quantified by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). The gambling behaviour of participants (bet increases, slot machine switches and double or nothing gambles) was associated with this self-reported measure of impulsivity. However, there was a large variance in outcome amongst participants, and we were interested in whether individual differences in subjective estimates of uncertainty (specifically, volatility) were related to differences in pre- and postoperative impulsivity. To examine these individual differences, we fit a computational model (the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, HGF), to choices made during slot machine game play as well as a simpler reinforcement learning model based on the Rescorla-Wagner formalism. The HGF was superior in accounting for the behaviour of our participants, suggesting that participants incorporated beliefs about environmental uncertainty when updating their beliefs about gambling outcome and translating these beliefs into action. A specific aspect of subjective uncertainty, the participant{\textquoteright}s estimate of the tendency of the slot machine{\textquoteright}s winning probability to change (volatility), increased subsequent to DBS. Additionally, the decision temperature of the response model decreased post-operatively, implying greater stochasticity in the belief-to-choice mapping of participants. Model parameter estimates were significantly associated with impulsivity; specifically, increased uncertainty was related to increased postoperative impulsivity. Moreover, changes in these parameter estimates were significantly associated with the maximum post-operative change in impulsivity over a six month follow up period. Our findings suggest that impulsivity in persons with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease may be influenced by subjective estimates of uncertainty (environmental volatility) and implicate a role for the subthalamic nucleus in the modulation of outcome certainty. Furthermore, our work outlines a possible approach to characterising those persons who become more impulsive after subthalamic DBS, an intervention in which non-motor outcomes can be highly variable.},

	abstract = {Human upright standing involves an integration of multiple sensory inputs such as vision, vestibular and somatosensory systems. It has been known that sensory deficits worsen the standing balance. However, how the modulation of sensory information contributes to postural stabilization still remains an open question for researchers. The purpose of this work was to formulate the human standing postural control system in the framework of the free-energy principle, and to investigate the efficacy of the skin stretch feedback in enhancing the human standing balance. Previously, we have shown that sensory augmentation by skin stretch feedback at the fingertip could modulate the standing balance of the people with simulated sensory deficits. In this study, subjects underwent ten 30-second trials of quiet standing balance with and without skin stretch feedback. Visual and vestibular sensory deficits were simulated by having each subject close their eyes and tilt their head back. We found that sensory augmentation by velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip reduced the entropy of the standing postural sway of the people with simulated sensory deficits. This result aligns with the framework of the free energy principle which states that a self-organizing biological system at its equilibrium state tries to minimize its free energy either by updating the internal state or by correcting body movement with appropriate actions. The velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip may increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensory signals, which in turn enhances the accuracy of the internal states in the central nervous system. With more accurate internal states, the human postural control system can further adjust the standing posture to minimize the entropy, and thus the free energy.},

	abstract = {Converging theories suggest that organisms learn and exploit probabilistic models of their environment. However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, action-oriented models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a bad-bootstrap. Here, we exploit the normative framework of active inference to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (information-seeking) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed because of, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {Background Reward-based decision-making is impaired in patients with schizophrenia (PSZ) as reflected by increased choice switching. The underlying cognitive and motivational processes as well as associated neural signatures remain unknown. Reinforcement Learning (RL) and hierarchical Bayesian learning account for choice switching in different ways. We hypothesized that enhanced choice switching, as seen in PSZ during reward-based decision-making, relates to higher-order beliefs about environmental volatility and examined the associated neural activity.Methods 46 medicated PSZ and 43 healthy controls (HC) performed a reward-based decision-making task requiring flexible responses to changing action-outcome contingencies during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Detailed computational modeling of choice data was performed, including RL and the hierarchical Gaussian filter (HGF). Trajectories of learning from computational modeling informed the analysis of fMRI data.Results A three-level HGF accounted best for the observed choice data. This model revealed a heightened initial belief about environmental volatility and a stronger influence of volatility on lower-level learning of action-outcome contingencies in PSZ as compared to HC. This was replicated in an independent sample of non-medicated PSZ. Beliefs about environmental volatility were reflected by higher activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of PSZ as compared to HC.Conclusions Our study suggests that PSZ inferred the environment as overly volatile, which may explain increased choice switching. In PSZ, activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more strongly related to beliefs about environmental volatility. Our computational phenotyping approach may provide useful information to dissect clinical heterogeneity and could improve prediction of outcome.},

	abstract = {Information sampling can reduce uncertainty in future decisions but is often costly. To maximize reward, people need to balance sampling cost and information gain. Here we aimed to understand how autistic traits influence the optimality of information sampling and to identify the particularly affected cognitive processes. Healthy human adults with different levels of autistic traits performed a probabilistic inference task, where they could sequentially sample information to increase their likelihood of correct inference and may choose to stop at any moment. We manipulated the cost and evidence associated with each sample and compared participants{\textquoteright} performance to strategies that maximize expected gain. We found that participants were overall close to optimal but also showed autistic-trait-related differences. Participants with higher autistic traits had a higher efficiency of winning rewards when the sampling cost was zero but a lower efficiency when the cost was high and the evidence was more ambiguous.Computational modeling of participants{\textquoteright} sampling choices and decision times revealed a two-stage decision process, with the second stage being an optional second thought. Participants may consider cost in the first stage and evidence in the second stage, or in the reverse order. The probability of choosing stopping at a specific stage increases with increasing cost or increasing evidence. Surprisingly, autistic traits did not influence the decision in either stage. However, participants with higher autistic traits inclined to consider cost first, while those with lower autistic traits considered cost or evidence first in a more balanced way. This would lead to the observed autistic-trait-related advantages or disadvantages in sampling optimality, depending on whether the optimal sampling strategy is determined only by cost or jointly by cost and evidence.Author Summary Children with autism can spend hours practicing lining up toys or learning all about cars or lighthouses. This kind of behaviors, we think, may reflect suboptimal information sampling strategies, that is, a failure to balance the gain of information with the cost (time, energy, or money) of information sampling. We hypothesized that suboptimal information sampling is a general characteristic of people with autism or high level of autistic traits. In our experiment, we tested how participants may adjust their sampling strategies with the change of sampling cost and information gain in the environment. Though all participants were healthy young adults who had similar IQs, higher autistic traits were associated with higher or lower efficiency of winning rewards under different conditions. Counterintuitively, participants with different levels of autistic traits did not differ in the general tendency of oversampling or undersampling, or in the decision they would reach when a specific set of sampling cost or information gain was considered. Instead, participants with higher autistic traits consistently considered sampling cost first and only weighed information gain during a second thought, while those with lower autistic traits had more diverse sampling strategies that consequently better balanced sampling cost and information gain.},

Furthermore, our results suggest that predictions leading to the N1-suppression effect are specific, as self-initiated deviant vowels do not elicit an N1-suppression effect. Rather, self-initiated deviant vowels elicit an enhanced N2b and P3a compared to externally-generated deviants, externally-generated standard, or self-initiated standards, again confirming prediction specificity.Results show that prediction errors are salient in self-initiated auditory speech sounds, which may lead to more efficient error correction in speech production.},

Coherence analyses revealed that, during reading aloud, the reader{\textquoteright}s brain tracked the slow temporal fluctuations of the speech output. Specifically, auditory cortices tracked phrasal structure (\&lt;1 Hz) but to a lesser extent than during the two speech listening conditions. Also, the tracking of syllable structure (4{\textendash}8 Hz) occurred at parietal opercula during reading aloud and at auditory cortices during listening. Directionality analyses based on renormalized partial directed coherence revealed that speech brain tracking at \&lt;1 Hz and 4{\textendash}8 Hz is dominated by speech-to-brain directional coupling during both reading aloud and listening, meaning that speech brain tracking mainly entails auditory feedback processing. Nevertheless, brain-to-speech directional coupling at 4{\textendash} 8 Hz was enhanced during reading aloud compared with listening, likely reflecting speech monitoring before production. Altogether, these data bring novel insights into how auditory verbal information is tracked by the human brain during perception and self-generation of connected speech.HighlightsThe brain tracks phrasal and syllabic rhythmicity of self-produced (read) speech.Tracking of phrasal structures is attenuated during reading compared with listening.Speech rhythmicity mainly drives brain activity during reading and listening.Brain activity drives syllabic rhythmicity more during reading than listening.},

Eye-movements in turn are partially guided by predictions about observed motion. Thus, the question arises whether knowledge about gravity is also used to guide eye-movements: If humans rely on a representation of earth gravity for the control of eye movements, earth-gravity-congruent motion should elicit improved visual pursuit. In a pre-registered experiment, we presented participants (n=10) with parabolic motion governed by six different gravities (-1/0.7/0.85/1/1.15/1.3g), two initial vertical velocities and two initial horizontal velocities in a 3D environment. Participants were instructed to follow the target with their eyes. We tracked their gaze and computed the visual gain (velocity of the eyes divided by velocity of the target) as proxy for the quality of pursuit. An LMM analysis with gravity condition as fixed effect and intercepts varying per subject showed that the gain was lower for -1g than for 1g (by-0.13, SE=0.005). This model was significantly better than a null model without gravity as fixed effect (p\&lt;0.001), supporting our hypothesis. A comparison of 1g and the remaining gravity conditions revealed that 1.15g (by 0.043, SE=0.005) and 1.3g (by 0.065, SE=0.005) were associated with lower gains, while 0.7g (by 0.054, SE=0.005) and 0.85g (by 0.029, SE=0.005) were associated with higher gains. This model was again significantly better than a null model (p\&lt;0.001), contradicting our hypothesis. Post-hoc analyses reveal that confounds in the 0.7/0.85/1/1.15/1.3g condition may be responsible for these contradicting results. Despite these discrepancies, our data thus provide some support for the hypothesis that internalized knowledge about earth gravity guides eye movements.},

Here, I propose an information theoretic framework that has the potential to explain the ensemble of these findings as reflecting pupillary response to information processing. In short, updates of brain internal model, quantified formally as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between prior and posterior beliefs, are the common denominator to all these instances of pupillary dilation to cognition. I show that stimulus presentation leads to pupillary response that is proportional to the amount of information the stimulus carries about itself and to the quantity of information it provides about other task variables. In the context of decision making, pupil dilation in relation to uncertainty is explained by the wandering of the evidence accumulation process, leading to large summed KL divergences. Finally, pupillary response to mental effort and variations in tonic pupil size are also formalized in terms of information theory. On the basis of this framework, I compare pupillary data from past studies to simple information theoretic simulations of task designs and show good correspondance with data across studies. The present framework has the potential to unify the large set of results reported on pupillary dilation to cognition and to provide a theory to guide future research.},

	abstract = {This paper offers a formal account of emotional inference and stress-related behaviour, using the notion of active inference. We formulate responses to stressful scenarios in terms of Bayesian belief-updating and subsequent policy selection; namely, planning as (active) inference. Using a minimal model of how creatures or subjects account for their sensations (and subsequent action), we deconstruct the sequences of belief updating and behaviour that underwrite stress-related responses {\textendash} and simulate the aberrant responses of the sort seen in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Crucially, the model used for belief-updating generates predictions in multiple (exteroceptive, proprioceptive and interoceptive) modalities, to provide an integrated account of evidence accumulation and multimodal integration that has consequences for both motor and autonomic responses. The ensuing phenomenology speaks to many constructs in the ecological and clinical literature on stress, which we unpack with reference to simulated inference processes and accompanying neuronal responses. A key insight afforded by this formal approach rests on the trade-off between the epistemic affordance of certain cues (that resolve uncertainty about states of affairs in the environment) and the consequences of epistemic foraging (that may be in conflict with the instrumental or pragmatic value of {\textquoteleft}fleeing{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}freezing{\textquoteright}).

	abstract = {Having something to look forward to is a keystone of well-being. Anticipation of a future reward, like an upcoming vacation, can often be more gratifying than the very experience itself. Theories of anticipation have described how it induces behaviors ranging from beneficial information-seeking through to harmful addiction. However, it remains unclear how neural systems compute an attractive value from anticipation, instead of from the reward itself. To address this gap, we administered a decision-making task to human participants that allowed us to analyze brain activity during receipt of information predictive of future pleasant outcomes. Using a computational model of anticipatory value that captures participants{\textquoteright} decisions, we show that an anticipatory value signal is orchestrated by influences from three brain regions. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracks the value of anticipation; dopaminergic midbrain responds to information that enhances anticipation, while sustained hippocampal activity provides a functional coupling between these regions. This coordinating function of the hippocampus is consistent with its known role in episodic future thinking. Our findings shed new light on the neural underpinnings of anticipation{\textquoteright}s influence over decision-making, while also unifying a range of phenomena associated with risk and time-delay preference.},

	abstract = {A defining feature of sleep is reduced responsiveness to external stimuli, but the mechanisms gating sensory-evoked arousal remain unclear. We hypothesized that reduced locus-coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) activity during sleep mediates unresponsiveness, and its action promotes sensory-evoked awakenings. We tested this using electrophysiological, behavioral, pharmacological, and optogenetic techniques alongside auditory stimulation in freely behaving rats. We found that systemic reduction of NE signaling lowered probability of sound-evoked awakenings (SEAs). The level of tonic LC activity during sleep anticipated SEAs. Optogenetic LC activation promoted arousal as evident in sleep-wake transitions, EEG desynchronization, and pupil dilation. Importantly, liminal LC excitation before sound presentation increased SEA probability. Optogenetic LC silencing using a soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsin (stGtACR2) suppressed LC spiking and constricted pupils. Brief periods of LC opto-silencing reduced the probability of SEAs. Thus, LC-NE activity determines the likelihood of sensory-evoked awakenings and its reduction during sleep constitutes a key factor mediating behavioral unresponsiveness.},

However, the mechanisms underlying the so-called body ownership are yet not fully understood. The plasticity of body ownership has been studied using two experimental methods or their variations. Specifically, the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI), where the tactile stimuli are externally generated, or the moving RHI which implies self-initiated movements. Grounded in these paradigms, evidence has demonstrated that body ownership is a product of bottom-up reception of self- and externally-generated multisensory information and top-down comparison between the predicted and the actual sensory stimuli. Crucially, provided the design of the current paradigms, where one of the manipulated cues always involves the processing of a proximal modality sensing the body or its surface (e.g., touch), the contribution of sensory signals which pertain to the environment remain elusive. Here we propose that, as any robust percept, body ownership depends on the integration and prediction of all the sensory stimuli, and therefore it will depend on the consistency of purely distal sensory signals pertaining to the environment. To test our hypothesis, we create an embodied goal-oriented task and manipulate the predictability of the surrounding environment by changing the congruency of purely distal multisensory cues while preserving bodily and action-driven signals entirely predictable. Our results empirically reveal that the way we represent our body is contingent upon all the sensory stimuli including purely distal and action-independent signals which pertain to the environment.},

	abstract = {This paper offers a formal account of policy learning, or habitual behavioural optimisation, under the framework of Active Inference. In this setting, habit formation becomes an autodidactic, experience-dependent process, based upon what the agent sees itself doing. We focus on the effect of environmental volatility on habit formation by simulating artificial agents operating in a partially observable Markov decision process. Specifically, we used a {\textquoteleft}two-step{\textquoteright} maze paradigm, in which the agent has to decide whether to go left or right to secure a reward. We observe that in volatile environments with numerous reward locations, the agents learn to adopt a generalist strategy, never forming a strong habitual behaviour for any preferred maze direction. Conversely, in conservative or static environments, agents adopt a specialist strategy; forming strong preferences for policies that result in approach to a small number of previously-observed reward locations. The pros and cons of the two strategies are tested and discussed. In general, specialization offers greater benefits, but only when contingencies are conserved over time. We consider the implications of this formal (Active Inference) account of policy learning for understanding the relationship between specialisation and habit formation.Author Summary Active inference is a theoretical framework that formalizes the behaviour of any organism in terms of a single imperative {\textendash} to minimize surprise. Starting from this principle, we can construct simulations of simple {\textquotedblleft}agents{\textquotedblright} (artificial organisms) that show the ability to infer causal relationships and learn. Here, we expand upon currently-existing implementations of Active Inference by enabling synthetic agents to optimise the space of behavioural policies that they can pursue. Our results show that by adapting the probabilities of certain action sequences (which may correspond biologically to the phenomenon of synaptic plasticity), and by rejecting improbable sequences (synaptic pruning), the agents can begin to form habits. Furthermore, we have shown our agent{\textquoteright}s habit formation to be environment-dependent. Some agents become specialised to a constant environment, while other adopt a more general strategy, each with sensible pros and cons. This work has potential applications in computational psychiatry, including in behavioural phenotyping to better understand disorders.},

	abstract = {Belief updating entails the incorporation of new information about the environment into internal models of the world. Bayesian inference is the statistically optimal strategy for performing belief updating in the presence of uncertainty. An important open question is whether the use of cognitive strategies that implement Bayesian inference is dependent upon motivational state and, if so, how this is reflected in electrophysiological signatures of belief updating in the brain. Here we recorded the electroencephalogram of participants performing a simple reward learning task with both monetary and non-monetary instructive feedback conditions. Our aim was to distinguish the influence of the rewarding properties of feedback on belief updating from the information content of the feedback itself. A Bayesian updating model allowed us to quantify different aspects of belief updating across trials, including the size of belief updates and the uncertainty of beliefs. Faster learning rates were observed in the monetary feedback condition compared to the instructive feedback condition, while belief updates were generally larger, and belief uncertainty smaller, with monetary compared to instructive feedback. Larger amplitudes in the monetary feedback condition were found for three event-related potential components: the P3a, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the late positive potential (LPP). These findings suggest that motivational state influences inference strategies in reward learning, and this is reflected in the electrophysiological correlates of belief updating.},

However, it is not clear how the brain acquires predictive representations during goal-directed learning. Here, we show using fMRI that while participants learned to find rewards in multiple different Y-maze environments, hippocampal activity was highest during initial exposure and then decayed across the remaining repetitions of each maze, consistent with a role in rapid encoding. Importantly, multivariate patterns in the OFC-VPFC came to represent predictive information about upcoming states approximately 30 seconds in the future.

Value-based decision-making commonly involves deliberation, a time-consuming process that requires conscious consideration of decision variables. Perception, by contrast, is thought to be automatic and effortless. To determine if inference characterizes both perception and value-based decision-making, we directly compared uncertainty signals in visual perception and an economic task using fMRI. We presented the same individuals with different versions of a bi-stable figure (Necker{\textquoteright}s cube) and with a gambling task during fMRI acquisition. To track the inferential process assumed in both tasks, we experimentally varied uncertainty, either on perceptual state or financial outcome. We found that inferential errors captured by surprise in the gambling task yielded BOLD responses in the anterior insula, in line with earlier findings. Moreover, we found perceptual risk and surprise in the Necker Cube task yielded similar responses in the anterior insula. These results suggest that uncertainty, irrespective of domain, correlates to a common brain region, the anterior insula. These findings provide empirical evidence that the brain interacts with its environment through inferential processes.},

Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as {\textquotedblleft}unconscious{\textquotedblright}. An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jh{\={a}}na meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jh{\={a}}na consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness.This paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jh{\={a}}na meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and {\textquotedblleft}present{\textquotedblright} in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display {\textquotedblleft}spindle{\textquotedblright} activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage infraslow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.},

	abstract = {Several decision-making vulnerabilities have been identified as underlying causes for addictive behaviours, or the repeated execution of stereotyped actions despite their adverse consequences. These vulnerabilities are mostly associated with brain alterations caused by the consumption of substances of abuse. However, addiction can also happen in the absence of a pharmacological component, such as seen in pathological gambling and videogaming. We use a new reinforcement learning model to highlight a previously neglected vulnerability that we suggest interacts with those already identified, whilst playing a prominent role in non-pharmacological forms of addiction. Specifically, we show that a duallearning system (i.e. combining model-based and model-free) can be vulnerable to highly rewarding, but suboptimal actions, that are followed by a complex ramification of stochastic adverse effects. This phenomenon is caused by the overload of the capabilities of an agent, as time and cognitive resources required for exploration, deliberation, situation recognition, and habit formation, all increase as a function of the depth and richness of detail of an environment. Furthermore, the cognitive overload can be aggravated due to alterations (e.g. caused by stress) in the bounded rationality, i.e. the limited amount of resources available for the model-based component, in turn increasing the agent{\textquoteright}s chances to develop or maintain addictive behaviours. Our study demonstrates that, independent of drug consumption, addictive behaviours can arise in the interaction between the environmental complexity and the biologically finite resources available to explore and represent it.},

	abstract = {Behavioral adaptations during performance rely on predicting and evaluating the consequences of our actions through action monitoring. Previous studies revealed that proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals contribute to error-monitoring processes, which are implemented in the posterior medial frontal cortex. Interestingly, errors also trigger changes in autonomic nervous system activity such as pupil dilation or heartbeat deceleration. Yet, the contribution of implicit interoceptive signals of bodily states to error-monitoring during ongoing performance has been overlooked.This study investigated whether cardiovascular interoceptive signals influence the neural correlates of error processing during performance, with an emphasis on the early stages of error processing. We recorded musicians{\textquoteright} electroencephalography and electrocardiogram signals during the performance of highly-trained music pieces. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies revealed that pitch errors during skilled musical performance are preceded by an error detection signal, the pre-error-negativity (preERN), and followed by a later error positivity (PE). In this study, by combining ERP, source localization and multivariate pattern classification analysis, we found that the error-minus-correct ERP waveform had an enhanced amplitude within 40-100 ms following errors in the systolic period of the cardiac cycle. This component could be decoded from singletrials, was dissociated from the preERN and PE, and stemmed from the inferior parietal cortex, which is a region implicated in cardiac autonomic regulation. In addition, the phase of the cardiac cycle influenced behavioral alterations resulting from errors, with a smaller post-error slowing and less perturbed velocity in keystrokes following pitch errors in the systole relative to the diastole phase of the cardiac cycle. Lastly, changes in the heart rate anticipated the upcoming occurrence of errors. This study provides the first evidence of preconscious visceral information modulating neural and behavioral responses related to early error monitoring during skilled performance.},

	abstract = {The human brain is thought to optimise the encoding of incoming sensory information through two principal mechanisms: prediction uses stored information to guide the interpretation of forthcoming sensory events, and attention prioritizes these events according to their behavioural relevance. Despite the ubiquitous contributions of attention and prediction to various aspects of perception and cognition, it remains unknown how they interact to modulate information processing in the brain. A recent extension of predictive coding theory suggests that attention optimises the expected precision of predictions by modulating the synaptic gain of prediction error units. Since prediction errors code for the difference between predictions and sensory signals, this model would suggest that attention increases the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to a surprising stimulus. Alternative predictive coding models proposes that attention increases the activity of prediction (or {\textquoteleft}representation{\textquoteright}) neurons, and would therefore suggest that attention and prediction synergistically modulate selectivity for feature information in the brain. Here we applied multivariate forward encoding techniques to neural activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) as human observers performed a simple visual task, to test for the effect of attention on both mismatch and feature information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. Participants attended or ignored a periodic stream of gratings, the orientations of which could be either predictable, surprising, or unpredictable. We found that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features, and that attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. These findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction modulate information processing in the brain, and support the theory that attention optimises precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.},

	abstract = {Hallucinations, including auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), occur in both the healthy population and in psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia (often developing after a prodromal period). In addition, hallucinations can be in-context (they can be consistent with the environment, such as when one hallucinates the end of a sentence that has been repeated many times), or out-of-context (such as the bizarre hallucinations associated with schizophrenia). In previous work, we introduced a model of hallucinations as false (positive) inferences based on a (Markov decision process) formulation of active inference. In this work, we extend this model to include content to disclose the computational mechanisms behind in- and out-of-context hallucinations. In active inference, sensory information is used to disambiguate alternative hypotheses about the causes of sensations. Sensory information is balanced against prior beliefs, and when this balance is tipped in the favor of prior beliefs, hallucinations can occur. We show that in-context hallucinations arise when (simulated) subjects cannot use sensory information to correct prior beliefs about hearing a voice, but beliefs about content (i.e. the sequential order of a sentence) remain accurate. When hallucinating subjects also have inaccurate beliefs about state transitions, out-of-context hallucinations occur; i.e. their hallucinated speech content is disordered. Furthermore, subjects with inaccurate beliefs about state transitions but an intact ability to use sensory information do not hallucinate and are reminiscent of prodromal patients. This work demonstrates the different computational mechanisms that may underlie the spectrum of hallucinatory experience from the healthy population to psychotic states.},

	abstract = {Expectancy shapes our perception of impending events. Although such an interplay between cognitive and affective processes is often impaired in mental disorders, it is not well understood how top-down expectancy signals modulate future affect. We therefore track the information flow in the brain during cognitive and affective processing segregated in time using task-specific cross-correlations. Participants in two independent fMRI studies (N1 = 37 \&amp; N2 = 55) were instructed to imagine a situation with affective content as indicated by a cue, which was then followed by an emotional picture congruent with expectancy. To correct for intrinsic covariance of brain function, we calculate resting-state cross-correlations analogous to the task. First, using factorial modeling of delta cross-correlations (task-rest) of the first study, we find that the magnitude of expectancy signals in the anterior insula cortex (AIC) modulates the BOLD response to emotional pictures in the anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in opposite directions. Second, using hierarchical linear modeling of lagged connectivity, we demonstrate that expectancy signals in the AIC indeed foreshadow this opposing pattern in the prefrontal cortex. Third, we replicate the results in the second study using a higher temporal resolution, showing that our task-specific cross-correlation approach robustly uncovers the dynamics of information flow. We conclude that the AIC arbitrates the recruitment of distinct prefrontal networks during cued picture processing according to triggered expectations. Taken together, our study provides new insights into neuronal pathways channeling cognition and affect within well-defined brain networks. Better understanding of such dynamics could lead to new applications tracking aberrant information processing in mental disorders.},

	abstract = {How can we certify our existence? Recent theoretical studies have suggested that, in the brain, the effect inversely infers the possibility of the existence of the self as the cause. While this Bayesian view of the sense of agency is widely accepted, empirical evidence in support of this theory is still lacking. The current study examined outcome-modulated agency in terms of time perception in seven experiments, with a total of 90 participants. It was hypothesized that perceptual generation, not termination, should subjectively infer the existence of the self, even though both include the same stimuli and are driven by the same teleological action. Results suggest support for the hypothesis (Experiments 1 and 2). Participants judged stronger self-agency, detected less delay, or felt shorter duration for auditory generation, compared with termination, which was driven by the same volitional key-press. Furthermore, the main experiment, Experiment 3, focused on temporal probability distributions both for action and outcome (e.g., standard deviations or relative entropy), and concluded that the observed contrast in onset/offset agency indicates a mutual or bidirectional relationship between cause and effect only during agentive action, characterized by active (i.e., teleological) generation. Finally, the concurrent theoretical models for volitional action-modulated time perception are discussed on the basis of the suggested triplet (generativity, teleology, and subjectivity) dimensions of agency.Extended abstract The sense of agency refers to the subjective experience of generating one{\textquoteright}s own actions (Gallagher, 2000). Within the past decade, research on this subject has increased, as increased understanding of human agency could be a window into knowing how we are aware of ourselves, and possibly allowing for a better understanding of mental illnesses, like schizophrenia. However, {\textquotedblleft}free will,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}self-consciousness,{\textquotedblright} and/or {\textquotedblleft}volition{\textquotedblright} are concepts that are always difficult to empirically investigate (Frith \&amp; Haggard, 2018). Researchers do not know exactly what occurs in our sensorium during {\textquotedblleft}agentive action.{\textquotedblright} However, three conceptions could represent genuine dimensions of agency: generativity, teleology, and subjectivity (Haggard, 2019).Recent theoretical studies have suggested that, in the brain, the effect inversely infers the possibility of the existence of the self as the cause. This Bayesian view of the sense of agency may provide an explanation for classical statements, such as {\textquotedblleft}ego cogito, ergo sum (I think, therefore I am),{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}cogito cogito, ergo cogito sum (I think that I think, therefore I think that I am),{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}I move, therefore I am,{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}I predict, therefore I am.{\textquotedblright} (e.g., Corlett, 2017). All of these theoretical claims implicitly refer to the Bayesian {\textquotedblleft}inverse{\textquotedblright} probability or inference (e.g., {\textquotedblleft}thought as action{\textquotedblright}), where the effect (perception) retrospectively postdicts the cause (action), as well as the action predicting the following perception (Figure 1, including generativity, teleology, and subjectivity as triplet dimensions of agency). This bidirectional temporal relationship between action and perception can be empirically examined in terms of the {\textquotedblleft}certification of the self{\textquotedblright} or self as prior.Figure 1. The theoretical hypothesis of cross-dependency between action and sensation in time.Note: Bayesian subjective probability ignores the order between cause and effect (i.e., the physical temporal arrow), even if we make a distinction between the two (prediction vs. postdiction). Furthermore, the posterior distributions (as a result of dissolving the pre/postdiction error) for action-timing and sensation-timing are mutually-tugged since both share the same prior (i.e., the self must be the immediate active generator, as the current study suggests). Icon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com.The current study examined effect-modulated agency in terms of time perception in seven experiments, conducted with a total of 90 participants. We hypothesized that perceptual generation, not termination, should inversely infer the self in action, even though both include the same stimuli, and are driven by the same action. Results support this hypothesis (Experiments 1 and 2). Participants judged stronger self-agency, detected less delay, or felt shorter duration for auditory generation, compared to termination, in instances driven by a key-press of his/her own volition, but may have also had different {\textquotedblleft}priors{\textquotedblright} (i.e., self or other, as a categorical causal structure selection or model weighting). Furthermore, the main experiment, Experiment 3, focused on probability distributions both for action and outcome on the same temporal axis (e.g., standard deviations or relative entropy), and concluded that this contrast in onset/offset agency indicates the mutual or bidirectional relationship between cause and effect only during agentive action, characterized by the active generation (Figure 2). In summary, results indicate that the self is learned as a prior to being an independent agent that can immediately cause actions to occur within the environment merely through one{\textquoteright}s own volition. This interpretation is highly congruent with the literal meaning of the sense of agency and also with the theory of the triplet dimensions of agency.Figure 2.

	abstract = {Anticipating meaningful actions in the environment is an essential function of the brain. Such predictive mechanisms originate from the motor system and allow for inferring actions from environmental affordances, the potential to act within a specific environment. Using architecture, we provide a unique perspective to the abiding debate in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy on whether cognition depends on movement or is decoupled from our physical structure. To investigate cognitive processes associated with architectural affordances, we used a Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach recording brain activity synchronized to head-mounted virtual reality. Participants perceived and acted upon virtual transitions ranging from non-passable to easily passable. We demonstrate that early sensory brain activity, upon revealing the environment and before actual movement, differed as a function of affordances. Additionally, movement through transitions was preceded by a motor-related negative component also depended on affordances. Our results suggest that potential actions afforded by an environment influence perception.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT By using electroencephalography and virtual reality, our research provide a unique perspective to the centurial open-ended debate in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy on the relation between cognition, movement and environment. Our results indicate that cortical potentials vary as a function of bodily affordances reflected by the physical environment. Firstly, the results of this study implies that cognition is inherently related to potential movement of the body, thus we advance that action is interrelated with perception, actively influencing the perceivable environment. Secondly, as cortical potentials are influenced by the potential to move, which in turn is the task of architectural design, architects holds largely a privilege of human health, and thus potentially capable of provoking and preventing physiological conditions.},

	abstract = {When producing a duration, for instance by pressing a key for one second, the brain relies on self-generated neuronal dynamics to monitor the {\textquotedblleft}flow of time{\textquotedblright}. Converging evidence has suggested that the brain can also monitor itself monitoring time. Here, we investigated which brain mechanisms support metacognitive inferences when self-generating timing behavior. Although studies have shown that participants can reliably detect temporal errors when generating a duration (Akdogan \&amp; Balci, 2017; Kononowicz et al., 2017), the neural bases underlying the evaluation and the monitoring of this self-generated temporal behavior are unknown. Theories of psychological time have also remained silent about such self-evaluation abilities. How are temporal errors inferred on the basis of purely internally driven brain dynamics without external reference for time? We contrasted the error-detection hypothesis, in which error-detection would result from the comparison of competing motor plans with the read-out hypothesis, in which errors would result from inferring the state of an internal code for motor timing. Human participants generated a time interval, and evaluated the magnitude of their timing (first and second order behavioral judgments, respectively) while being recorded with time-resolved neuroimaging. Focusing on the neural signatures following the termination of self-generated duration, we found several regions involved in performance monitoring, which displayed a linear association between the power of α (8-14 Hz) oscillations, and the duration of the produced interval. Altogether, our results support the read-out hypothesis and indicate that first-order signals may be integrated for the evaluation of self-generated behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT When typing on a keyboard, the brain estimates where the finger should land, but also when. The endogenous generation of the when in time is naturally accompanied by timing errors which, quite remarkably, participants can accurately rate as being too short or too long, and also by how much. Here, we explored the brain mechanisms supporting such temporal metacognitive inferences. For this, we contrasted two working hypotheses (error-detection vs. read-out), and showed that the pattern of evoked and oscillatory brain activity parsimoniously accounted best for a read-out mechanism. Our results suggest the existence of meta-representations of time estimates.},

	abstract = {Traditional neurobiological theories of musical emotions explain well why extreme music such as punk, hardcore or metal, whose vocal and instrumental characteristics share much similarity with acoustic threat signals, should evoke unpleasant feelings for a large proportion of listeners. Why it doesn{\textquoteright}t for metal music fans, however, remains a theoretical challenge: metal fans may differ from non-fans in how they process acoustic threat signals at the sub-cortical level, showing deactivated or reconditioned responses that differ from controls. Alternatively, it is also possible that appreciation for metal depends on the inhibition by cortical circuits of a normal low-order response to auditory threat. In a series of three experiments, we show here that, at a sensory level, metal fans actually react equally negatively, equally fast and even more accurately to cues of auditory threat in vocal and instrumental contexts than non-fans. Conversely, cognitive load somewhat appears to reduce fans{\textquoteright} appreciation of metal to the level reported by non-fans. Taken together, these results are not compatible with the idea that extreme music lovers do so because of a different low-level response to threat, but rather, highlight a critical contribution of higher-order cognition to the aesthetic experience. These results are discussed in the light of recent higher-order theories of emotional consciousness, which we argue should be generalized to the emotional experience of music across musical genres.},

Crucially, this effect of vocal self-perception on felt emotions was abolished when participants detected our manipulation either explicitly or implicitly.

We extended the standard normalization model, treating the numerator and denominator as stochastic quantities, and derived a method to infer the single-trial normalization strength, which cannot be measured directly. The model revealed a general reduction of response variability in macaque primary visual cortex for neurons that were more strongly normalized, and during trials in which normalization was inferred to be strong.

They can be effectively used to identify mechanism of action for new compounds and to infer functional activity of different cellular processes. Linking perturbation signatures to phenotypic studies opens up the possibility to model selected cellular phenotypes from gene expression data and to predict drugs interfering with the phenotype. At the same time, close association of transcriptomics changes with phenotypes can potentially mask the compound specific signatures. By linking perturbation transcriptomics data from the LINCS-L1000 project with cell viability phenotypic information upon genetic (from Achilles project) and chemical (from CTRP screen) perturbations for more than 90,000 signature - cell viability pairs, we show here that a cell death signature is a major factor behind perturbation signatures. We use this relationship to effectively predict cell viability from transcriptomics signatures, and identify and experimentally validate compounds that induce either cell death or proliferation. We also show that cellular toxicity can lead to an unexpected similarity of toxic compound signatures confounding the mechanism of action discovery. Consensus compound signatures predict cell-specific anti-cancer drug sensitivity, even if the drug signature is not measured in the same cell line. These signatures outperform conventional drug-specific features like nominal target and chemical fingerprints. Our results can help removing confounding factors of large scale transcriptomics perturbation screens and show that expression signatures boost prediction of drug sensitivity.},

Being recently emerged branch of psychiatry, computational psychiatry is geared toward mathematical modeling of psychiatric disorders. Harnessing power of computer sciences and statistics may bridge the complex nature of psychiatric illnesses with hidden brain computational mechanisms. Stress represents an adaptive response to environmental threats but, while getting chronic, it leads to progressive deflection from homeostasis or result in buildup of allostatic load, providing researches with unique opportunity to track patterns of deviations from adaptive responding toward full-blown disease development. Computational psychiatry toolkit enables us to quantitatively assess the extent of such deviations, to explicitly test competing hypotheses which compare the models with real data for goodness-of-fit and, finally, to tethering these computational operations to structural or functional brain alterations as may be revealed by non-invasive neuroimaging and stimulation techniques.It is worth noting that brain does not directly face environmental demands imposed on human or animal, but rather through detecting signals and acting out via bodily systems. Therefore, it is of critical importance to take homeostatic and allostatic mechanisms into account when considering sophisticated interactions between brain and body and how their partnership may result in establishment of stress-susceptible or resilient profiles.In this article, with a particulate focus on brain-gut interactions, we outline several possible directions to widen the scope of application of computational approach in mental health care field trying to integrate computational psychiatry, psychosomatics and nutritional medicine},

	abstract = {Movement-related theta oscillations in rodent hippocampus coordinate {\textquoteleft}forward sweeps{\textquoteright} of location-specific neural activity that could be used to evaluate spatial trajectories online. This raises the possibility that increases in human hippocampal theta power accompany the evaluation of upcoming spatial choices. To test this hypothesis, we measured neural oscillations during a spatial planning task that closely resembles a perceptual decision-making paradigm. In this task, participants searched visually for the shortest path between a start and goal location in novel mazes that contained multiple choice points, and were subsequently asked to make a spatial decision at one of those choice points. We observed ~4-8 Hz hippocampal/medial temporal lobe theta power increases specific to sequential planning that were negatively correlated with subsequent decision speed, where decision speed was inversely correlated with choice accuracy. These results implicate the hippocampal theta rhythm in decision tree search during planning in novel environments.The research was supported by a Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship to RKa (Ref: 101261/Z/13/Z) and a Wellcome Principal Research Fellowship to KJF (Ref: 088130/Z/09/Z).

	abstract = {Theorists have suggested that emotions are canonical responses to situations ancestrally linked to survival. If so, then emotions may be afforded by features of the sensory environment. However, few computationally explicit models describe how combinations of stimulus features evoke different emotions. Here we develop a convolutional neural network that accurately decodes images into 11 distinct emotion categories. We validate the model using over 25,000 images and movies and show that image content is sufficient to predict the category and valence of human emotion ratings. In two fMRI studies, we demonstrate that patterns of human visual cortex activity encode emotion category-related model output and can decode multiple categories of emotional experience. These results suggest that rich, category-specific emotion representations are embedded within the human visual system.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical predictive coding is an influential model of cortical organization, in which sequential hierarchical layers are connected by feedback connections carrying predictions, as well as feedforward connections carrying prediction errors. To date, however, predictive coding models have neglected to take into account that neural transmission itself takes time. For a time-varying stimulus, such as a moving object, this means that feedback predictions become misaligned with new sensory input. We present an extended model implementing both feed-forward and feedback extrapolation mechanisms that realigns feedback predictions to minimize prediction error. This realignment has the consequence that neural representations across all hierarchical stages become aligned in real-time. Using visual motion as an example, we show that the model is neurally plausible, that it is consistent with evidence of extrapolation mechanisms throughout the visual hierarchy, that it predicts several known motion-position illusions, and that it provides a solution to the temporal binding problem.},

Although the optimal solution to this trade-off is intractable, humans make use of two effective strategies: selectively exploring options with high uncertainty (directed exploration), and increasing the randomness of their choices when they are more uncertain (random exploration). Using a task that independently manipulates these two forms of exploration, we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms related to dopamine are associated with individual differences in exploration strategies. Variation in a gene linked to prefrontal dopamine (COMT) predicted the degree of directed exploration, as well as the overall randomness of responding. Variation in a gene linked to striatal dopamine (DARPP-32) predicted the degree of both directed and random exploration. These findings suggest that dopamine makes multiple contributions to exploration, depending on its afferent target.},

	abstract = {A major open question concerns how the brain governs the allocation of control between two distinct strategies for learning from reinforcement: model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. While there is evidence to suggest that the reliability of the predictions of the two systems is a key variable responsible for the arbitration process, another key variable has remained relatively unexplored: the role of task complexity. By using a combination of novel task design, computational modeling, and model-based fMRI analysis, we examined the role of task complexity alongside state-space uncertainty in the arbitration process between model-based and model-free RL. We found evidence to suggest that task complexity plays a role in influencing the arbitration process alongside state-space uncertainty. Participants tended to increase model-based RL control in response to increasing task complexity. However, they resorted to model-free RL when both uncertainty and task complexity were high, suggesting that these two variables interact during the arbitration process. Computational fMRI revealed that task complexity interacts with neural representations of the reliability of the two systems in the inferior prefrontal cortex bilaterally. These findings provide insight into how the inferior prefrontal cortex negotiates the trade-off between model-based and model-free RL in the presence of uncertainty and complexity, and more generally, illustrates how the brain resolves uncertainty and complexity in dynamically changing environments.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS - Elucidated the role of state-space uncertainty and complexity in model-based and model-free RL.- Found behavioral and neural evidence for complexity-sensitive prefrontal arbitration.- High task complexity induces explorative model-based RL.},

	abstract = {Emotion enhances episodic memory, an effect thought to be an adaptation to prioritise the memories that best serve evolutionary fitness. But viewing this effect largely in terms of prioritising what to encode or consolidate neglects broader rational considerations about what sorts of associations should be formed at encoding, and which should be retrieved later. Although neurobiological investigations have provided many mechanistic clues about how emotional arousal modulates item memory, these effects have not been wholly integrated with the cognitive and computational neuroscience of memory more generally.Here we apply the Context Maintenance and Retrieval Model (CMR, Polyn, Norman \&amp; Kahana, 2009) to this problem by extending it to describe the way people may represent and process emotional information. A number of ways to operationalise the effect of emotion were tested. The winning emotional CMR (eCMR) model reconceptualises emotional memory effects as arising from the modulation of a process by which memories become bound to ever-changing temporal and emotional contexts. eCMR provides a good qualitative fit for the emotional list-composition effect and the emotional oddball effect, illuminating how these effects are jointly determined by the interplay of encoding and retrieval processes. eCMR explains the increased advantage of emotional memories in delayed memory tests through the limited ability of retrieval to reinstate the temporal context of encoding.By leveraging the rich tradition of temporal context models, eCMR helps integrate existing effects of emotion and provides a powerful tool to test mechanisms by which emotion affects memory in a broad range of paradigms.},

Using a dataset of more than 500 subjects, we demonstrate the existence of such patterns and we describe a new computational architecture (Explore-Exploit) disentangling exploitation, random exploration and directed exploration in this large population of participants. The EE architecture provided a better fit to the choice data on multiple metrics. Parameter recovery and simulation analyses confirmed the superiority of the EE scheme over alternative schemes. Furthermore, using the EE model, we were able to replicate the reduction in directed exploration across lifespan, as previously reported in other paradigms. Finally, we provide a user-friendly toolbox enabling researchers to easily fit computational models on the IGT data, hence promoting reanalysis of the numerous datasets acquired in various populations of patients.},

	abstract = {Signals for reward or punishment attract attention preferentially, a principle termed {\textquoteleft}value-modulated attention capture{\textquoteright} (VMAC). The mechanisms that govern the allocation of attention resources can be described with a terminology that is more often applied to the control of overt behaviours, namely, the distinction between instrumental and Pavlovian control, and between model-free and model-based control. While instrumental control of VMAC can be either model-free or model-based, it is not known whether Pavlovian control of VMAC can be model-based. To decide whether this is possible we measured Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) while 20 healthy adults took part in a novel task. During the learning stage participants underwent aversive threat conditioning with two CSs, one that predicted pain (CS+) and one that predicted safety (CS-). Instructions given prior to the test stage in the task allowed participants to infer whether novel, ambiguous CSs (new_CS+/ new_CS-) were threatening or safe. Correct inference required combining stored internal representations and new propositional information, the hallmark of model-based control. SSVEP amplitudes quantified the amount of attention allocated to novel CSs on their very first presentation, before they were ever reinforced. We found that SSVEPs were higher for new_CS+ than new_CS-. This result is potentially indicative of model-based Pavlovian control of VMAC, but additional controls are necessary to verify this conclusively. This result underlines the potential transformative role of information and inference in emotion regulation.We thank N. Chater and C. Frith for the discussions that inspired this paradigm, A.

In contrast to exteroception, there is limited evidence for purely attentional effects on interoception. Here, we empirically tested if attentional focus modulates cortical processing of single heartbeats, using a newly-developed experimental paradigm to probe purely attentional differences between exteroceptive and interoceptive conditions in the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP). We found that the HEP is significantly higher during interoceptive compared to exteroceptive attention, in a time window of 520-580ms after the R-peak. Furthermore, this effect predicted self-report measures of autonomic system reactivity. This study thus provides direct evidence that the HEP is modulated by attention and supports recent interpretations of the HEP as a neural correlate of interoceptive prediction errors.},

However, recent research has found that the traditional target P3 consists of a mixture of stimulus-locked, response-locked, and latency variable P3-like positivities that can be functionally and topographically dissociated from one another. The current study aimed to extend previous results by examining target N2 and P3-like subcomponents indexing conflict detection and context updating at both low- and high-order levels in the neural hierarchy during control of target detection in a flanker task. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded from 45 young adults while they completed a hybrid go/nogo flanker task, and Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE) was applied to functionally dissociate these peaks and establish their roles in conflict detection and context updating. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses showed a stimulus-locked frontal N2 revealing early conflict detection and fast categorization of nogo, congruous and incongruous trials, resulting in subsequent frontal P3-like activity (high-order context updating) elicited by infrequent nogo trials in the latency-variable RIDE cluster, and by the perceptually difficult incongruous trials in the response-locked cluster. In turn, the perceptually easier and more frequent congruous trials did not elicit frontal P3-like activity, although all trial types did elicit parietally distributed P3-like activity (low-order context updating), mostly within the latency-variable cluster. These novel findings support the presence of up to three distinct high-order task-set units regulating performance in our flanker task, as indexed by split-second, dynamic information transmission across frontal and parietal scalp regions.},

	abstract = {Predictive coding postulates that we make (top-down) predictions about the world and that we continuously compare incoming (bottom-up) sensory information with these predictions, in order to update our models and perception so as to better reflect reality. That is, our so-called {\textquoteleft}Bayesian brains{\textquoteright} continuously create and update generative models of the world, inferring (hidden) causes from (sensory) consequences. Neuroimaging datasets enable the detailed investigation of such modelling and updating processes, and these datasets can themselves be analysed with Bayesian approaches. These offer methodological advantages over classical statistics. Specifically, any number of models can be compared, the models need not be nested, and the {\textquoteleft}null model{\textquoteright} can be accepted (rather than only failing to be rejected as in frequentist inference). This methodological paper explains how to construct posterior probability maps (PPMs) for Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) at the group level using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. The method has only recently been used for EEG data, after originally being developed and applied in the context of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. Here, we describe how this method can be adapted for EEG using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software package for MATLAB. The method enables the comparison of an arbitrary number of hypotheses (or explanations for observed responses), at each and every voxel in the brain (source level) and/or in the scalp-time volume (scalp level), both within participants and at the group level. The method is illustrated here using mismatch negativity (MMN) data from a group of participants performing an audio-spatial oddball attention task. All data and code are provided in keeping with the Open Science movement. In so doing, we hope to enable others in the field of M/EEG to implement our methods so as to address their own questions of interest.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus is known to store cognitive representations, or maps, that encode both positional and contextual information, critical for episodic memories and functional behavior. How path integration and contextual cues are dynamically combined and processed by the hippocampus to maintain these representations accurate over time remains unclear. To answer this question, we propose a two-way data analysis and modeling approach to CA3 multi-electrode recordings of a moving rat submitted to rapid changes of contextual (light) cues, triggering back-and-forth instabitilies between two cognitive representations (Jezek et al, Nature 478, p 246 (2011)). We develop a dual neural activity decoder, capable of independently identifying the recalled cognitive map at high temporal resolution (comparable to theta cycle) and the position of the rodent given a map. Remarkably, position can be reconstructed at any time with an accuracy comparable to fixed-context periods, even during highly unstable periods. These findings provide evidence for the capability of the hippocampal neural activity to maintain an accurate encoding of spatial and contextual variables, while one of these variables undergoes rapid changes independently of the other. To explain this result we introduce an attractor neural network model for the hippocampal activity that process inputs from external cues and the path integrator. Our model allows us to make predictions on the frequency of the cognitive map instability, its duration, and the detailed nature of the place-cell population activity, which are validated by a further analysis of the data. Our work therefore sheds light on the mechanisms by which the hippocampal network achieves and updates multi-dimensional neural representations from various input streams.Author summary As an animal moves in space and receives external sensory inputs, it must dynamically maintain the representations of its position and environment at all times. How the hippocampus, the brain area crucial for spatial representations, achieves this task, and manages possible conflicts between different inputs remains unclear. We propose here a comprehensive attractor neural network-based model of the hippocampus and of its multiple input streams (including self-motion). We show that this model is capable of maintaining faithful representations of positional and contextual information, and resolves conflicts by adapting internal representations to match external cues. Model predictions are confirmed by the detailed analysis of hippocampal recordings of a rat submitted to quickly varying and conflicting contextual inputs.},

This perception can be unimodal (visual or auditory) or multimodal (visual and auditory). The increase in TMS-measured CSE is typically prominent for muscles involved in the perceived action (muscle specificity). There are two main classes of accounts for this phenomenon. One suggests that the motor system mirrors the actions that the observer perceives (the resonance account). The other suggests that the motor system predicts the actions that the observer perceives (the predictive account). To test these accounts (which need not be mutually exclusive), subjects were presented with four versions of three-note piano sequences: sound only, sight only, audiovisual, and audiovisual with sound lagging behind while CSE was measured in two hand muscles. Muscle specificity did not interact with modality in the flexor digiti minimi (FDM), but was reliably higher for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) while subjects perceived the audiovisual version of the three-note piano sequences with sound lagging behind. Since this version of the three-note piano sequences is the only one that overtly violates experience-based expectations, this finding supports predictive coding accounts of motor facilitation during action perception.},

A previously reported GOF mutant mouse knock-in (Gnao1+/G184S) was also studied for comparison.ResultsGnao1+/G203R mutant mice are viable and gain weight comparably to controls. Homozygotes are non-viable. Grip strength was decreased in both males and females. Male Gnao1+/G203R mice were strongly affected in movement assays (RotaRod and DigiGait) while females were not. Male Gnao1+/G203R mice also showed enhanced seizure propensity in the pentylenetetrazole kindling test. Mice with a G184S GOF knock-in also showed movement-related behavioral phenotypes but females were more strongly affected than males.ConclusionsGnao1+/G203R mice phenocopy children with heterozygous GNAO1 G203R mutations, showing both movement disorder and a relatively mild epilepsy pattern. This mouse model should be useful in mechanistic and preclinical studies of GNAO1-related movement disorders.},

	abstract = {In the past few decades, probabilistic interpretations of brain functions have become widespread in cognitive science and neuroscience. The Bayesian brain hypothesis, predictive coding, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to unify understandings of life and cognition within general mathematical frameworks derived from information and control theory, statistical physics and machine learning. The connections between information and control theory have been discussed since the 1950{\textquoteright}s by scientists like Shannon and Kalman and have recently risen to prominence in modern stochastic optimal control theory. However, the implications of the confluence of these two theoretical frameworks for the biological sciences have been slow to emerge. Here we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, we need to consider how existing control theoretical approaches to biological systems relate to it. In this work we will focus on PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, one of the most common types of regulators employed in engineering and more recently used to explain behaviour in biological systems, e.g. chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae or robust adaptation in biochemical networks. Using active inference, we derive a probabilistic interpretation of PID controllers, showing how they can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation under simple linear generative models.},

	abstract = {The locus coeruleus (LC) in the pons is the major source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. Two modes of LC firing have been associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing are correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses are evoked by salient stimuli. Here, we unify these two modes of firing by modelling the response of the LC as a correlate of a prediction error when inferring states for action planning under Active Inference (AI).We simulate a classic Go/No-go reward learning task and a three-arm foraging task and show that, if LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level {\textquoteleft}state-action{\textquoteright} prediction errors, then both tonic and phasic modes of firing are emergent features of belief updating. We also demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents can update their internal models more quickly by feeding back this state-action prediction error {\textendash} reflected in LC firing and noradrenaline release {\textendash} to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments over short timescales. We propose that such prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from LC to cortex modulates belief updating in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).In short, we characterise the LC/ NA system within a general theory of brain function. In doing so, we show that contrasting, behaviour-dependent firing patterns are an emergent property of the LC{\textquoteright}s crucial role in translating prediction errors into an optimal mediation between plasticity and stability.Author Summary The brain uses sensory information to build internal models and make predictions about the world. When errors of prediction occur, models must be updated to ensure desired outcomes are still achieved. Neuromodulator chemicals provide a possible pathway for triggering such changes in brain state. One such neuromodulator, noradrenaline, originates predominantly from a cluster of neurons in the brainstem {\textendash} the locus coeruleus (LC) {\textendash} and plays a key role in behaviour, for instance, in determining the balance between exploiting or exploring the environment.Here we use Active Inference (AI), a mathematical model of perception and action, to formally describe LC function. We propose that LC activity is triggered by errors in prediction and that the subsequent release of noradrenaline alters the rate of learning about the environment. Biologically, this describes an LC-cortex feedback loop promoting behavioural flexibility in times of uncertainty. We model LC output as a simulated animal performs two tasks known to elicit archetypal responses. We find that experimentally observed {\textquoteleft}phasic{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}tonic{\textquoteright} patterns of LC activity emerge naturally, and that modulation of learning rates improves task performance. This provides a simple, unified computational account of noradrenergic computational function within a general model of behaviour.},

	abstract = {In this work, we address the neuronal encoding problem from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, we ask whether neuronal responses in an in vitro neuronal network are consistent with ideal Bayesian observer responses under the free energy principle. In brief, we stimulated an in vitro cortical cell culture with stimulus trains that had a known statistical structure. We then asked whether recorded neuronal responses were consistent with variational message passing (i.e., belief propagation) based upon free energy minimisation (i.e., evidence maximisation). Effectively, this required us to solve two problems: first, we had to formulate the Bayes-optimal encoding of the causes or sources of sensory stimulation, and then show that these idealised responses could account for observed electrophysiological responses. We describe a simulation of an optimal neural network (i.e., the ideal Bayesian neural code) and then consider the mapping from idealised in silico responses to recorded in vitro responses. Our objective was to find evidence for functional specialisation and segregation in the in vitro neural network that reproduced in silico learning via free energy minimisation. Finally, we combined the in vitro and in silico results to characterise learning in terms of trajectories in a variational information plane of accuracy and complexity.},

	abstract = {Neurons typically release both a small molecule neurotransmitter and one or more neuropeptides, but how these two types of signal from the same neuron might act together remains largely obscure. For example, serotonergic neurons in mammalian brain express the neuropeptide Substance P, but it is unclear how serotonin signaling might be modulated by a coreleased neuropeptide. We studied this issue in C. elegans, in which all serotonergic neurons express the neuropeptide NLP-3. The serotonergic Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) are command motor neurons within the egg-laying circuit that have previously been shown to release serotonin to initiate egg-laying behavior. We found that egg-laying defects in animals lacking serotonin were far milder than in animals lacking HSNs, suggesting that HSNs must release other signal(s) in addition to serotonin to stimulate egg laying. While null mutants for nlp-3 had only mild egg-laying defects, animals lacking both serotonin and NLP-3 had severe defects, like those of animals lacking HSNs. Optogenetic activation of HSNs induced egg laying in wild-type animals, or in mutant animals lacking either serotonin or NLP-3, but failed to induce egg laying in animals lacking both. We recorded calcium activity in the egg-laying muscles of animals lacking either serotonin, NLP-3, or both. The single mutants, and to a greater extent the double mutant, showed muscle activity that was uncoordinated and unable to expel eggs, such that the vm2 muscles cells that are direct postsynaptic targets of the HSN failed to contract simultaneously with other egg-laying muscle cells. Our results show that the HSN neurons use serotonin and the neuropeptide NLP-3 as partially redundant cotransmitters that together stimulate and coordinate activity of the target cells onto which they are released.},

	abstract = {Movement in Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) is fragmented, and the patients depend on visual information in their behavior. This suggests that the patients may have deficits in internally monitoring their own movements. Internal monitoring of movements is assumed to rely on corollary discharge signals that enable the brain to predict the sensory consequences of actions. We studied early-stage PD patients (N=14), and age-matched healthy control participants (N=14) to examine whether PD patients reveal deficits in updating their sensory representations after eye movements. The participants performed a double-saccade task where, in order to accurately fixate a second target, the participant must correct for the displacement caused by the first saccade. In line with previous reports, the patients had difficulties in fixating the second target when the eye movement was performed without visual guidance. Furthermore, the patients had difficulties in taking into account the error in the first saccade when making a saccade towards the second target, especially when eye movements were made towards the side with dominant motor symptoms. Across PD patients, the impairments in saccadic eye movements correlated with the integrity of the dopaminergic system as measured with [123I]FP-CIT SPECT: Patients with lower striatal (caudate, anterior putamen and posterior putamen) dopamine transporter binding made larger errors in saccades. This effect was strongest when patients made memory-guided saccades towards the second target. Our results provide tentative evidence that the motor deficits in PD may be partly accounted by deficits in internal monitoring of movements.},

	abstract = {The Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) is a popular model of behaviour that accounts for patterns of accuracy and reaction time data. In the Full DDM implementation, parameters are allowed to vary from trial-to-trial, making the model more powerful but also more challenging to fit to behavioural data. Current approaches yield typically poor fitting quality, are computationally expensive and usually require assuming constant threshold parameter across trials. Moreover, in most versions of the DDM, the sequence of participants{\textquoteright} choices is considered independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), a condition often violated in real data.Our contribution to the field is threefold: first, we introduce Variational Bayes as a method to fit the full DDM. Second, we relax the i.i.d. assumption, and propose a data-driven algorithm based on a Recurrent Auto-Encoder (RAE-DDM), that estimates the local posterior probability of the DDM parameters at each trial based on the sequence of parameters and data preceding the current data point. Finally, we extend this algorithm to illustrate that the RAE-DDM provides an accurate modelling framework for regression analysis. An important result of the approach we propose is that inference at the trial level can be achieved efficiently for each and every parameter of the DDM, threshold included. This data-driven approach is highly generic and self-contained, in the sense that no external input (e.g. regressors or physiological measure) is necessary to fit the data. Using simulations, we show that this method outperforms i.i.d.-based approaches (either Markov Chain Monte Carlo or i.i.d.-VB) without making any assumption about the nature of the between-trial correlation of the parameters.},

	abstract = {Establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-evoked brain activity is critical because it would provide a way to map task-related brain regions in patients unable to comply with such tasks. A crucial question within this realm is to what extent the execution of a cognitive task affects the intrinsic activity of brain regions not involved in the task. Computational models can be useful to answer this question because they allow us to distinguish task from non-task neural elements while giving us the effects of task execution on non-task regions of interest at the neuroimaging level. The quantification of those effects in a computational model would represent a step towards elucidating the intrinsic versus task-evoked connection. Here we used computational modeling and graph theoretical metrics to quantify changes in intrinsic functional brain connectivity due to task execution. We used our Large-Scale Neural Modeling framework to embed a computational model of visual short-term memory into an empirically derived connectome. We simulated a neuroimaging study consisting of ten subjects performing passive fixation (PF), passive viewing (PV) and delay match-to-sample (DMS) tasks. We used the simulated BOLD fMRI time-series to calculate functional connectivity (FC) matrices and used those matrices to compute several graph theoretical measures. After determining that the simulated graph theoretical measures were largely consistent with experiments, we were able to quantify the differences between the graph metrics of the PF condition and those of the PV and DMS conditions. Thus, we show that we can use graph theoretical methods applied to simulated brain networks to aid in the quantification of changes in intrinsic brain functional connectivity during task execution. Our results represent a step towards establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-related brain activity.Author Summary Studies of resting-state conditions are popular in neuroimaging. Participants in resting-state studies are instructed to fixate on a neutral image or to close their eyes. This type of study has advantages over traditional task-based studies, including its ability to allow participation of those with difficulties performing tasks. Further, a resting-state neuroimaging study reveals intrinsic activity of participants{\textquoteright} brains. However, task-related brain activity may change this intrinsic activity, much as a stone thrown in a lake causes ripples on the water{\textquoteright}s surface. Can we measure those activity changes? To answer that question, we merged a computational model of visual short-term memory (task regions) with an anatomical model incorporating major connections between brain regions (non-task regions). In a computational model, unlike real data, we know how different regions are connected and which regions are doing the task. First, we simulated neuronal and neuroimaging activity of both task and non-task regions during three conditions: passive fixation (baseline), passive viewing, and visual short-term memory. Then, applying graph theory to the simulated neuroimaging of non-task regions, we computed differences between the baseline and the other conditions. Our results show that we can measure changes in non-task regions due to brain activity changes in task-related regions.},

However, in most extant paradigms, social information comprises an indirect source that can be used to supplement one{\textquoteright}s own, direct, experience. Thus, social and individual learning differ both in terms of social nature (social versus non-social) and directness (indirect versus direct). To test whether the dissociation between social and individual learning is best explained in terms of social nature or directness, we used a catecholaminergic challenge known to modulate learning. Two groups completed a decision-making task which required direct learning, from own experience, and indirect learning from an additional source. The groups differed in terms of whether the indirect source was social or non-social. The catecholamine transporter blocker, methylphenidate, affected direct learning by improving adaptation to changes in the volatility of the environment but there was no effect of methylphenidate on learning from the social or non-social indirect source. Thus, we report positive evidence for a dissociable effect of methylphenidate on direct and indirect learning, but no evidence for a distinction between social and non-social. These data fail to support the adaptive specialisation view, instead providing evidence for distinct mechanisms for direct versus indirect learning.},

Conversely, in the second (generalised free energy); priors over outcomes become an explicit component of the generative model. When using the free energy function, which is blind to counterfactual (i.e., future) observations, we equip the generative model with a prior over policies that ensure preferred (i.e., priors over) outcomes are realised. In other words, selected policies minimise uncertainty about future outcomes by minimising the free energy expected in the future. When using the free energy functional {\textendash} that effectively treats counterfactual observations as hidden states {\textendash} we show that policies are inferred or selected that realise prior preferences by minimising the free energy of future expectations. Interestingly, the form of posterior beliefs about policies (and associated belief updating) turns out to be identical under both formulations, but the quantities used to compute them are not.},

Here, a two-step stochastic trivia quiz designed to induce curiosity and manipulate answer uncertainty provided behavioural and neural evidence for an integrative model of EC inspired from predictive coding. More precisely, our behavioural data indicated an inverse relationship between average surprise and EC levels, which depended upon hemodynamic activity in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex from one trial to another and from one individual to another. Complementary, the elicitation of epistemic surprise and the relief of acute curiosity states were respectively related to ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum activity. Taken together, our results account for the temporal evolution of EC over time, as well as for the interplay of EC, prior knowledge and surprise in controlling memory gain.},

We consider a theoretical and neurobiologically plausible solution that enables inference and learning under multiple generative models by integrating active inference and (online) Bayesian model selection. This scheme fits sensory inputs under each generative model. Model parameters are then updated in proportion to the probability it could have generated the current input (i.e., model evidence).

	abstract = {Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models can only re-use policies as a whole and are unable to transfer knowledge about the transition structure of the environment even if only the goal has changed (or vice-versa). This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions, affording separable transfer of their constituent parts across contexts. We show that the relative performance of this agent compared to an agent that jointly clusters reward and transition functions depends environmental task statistics: the mutual information between transition and reward functions and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and propose a meta learning agent that dynamically arbitrates between strategies across task domains to optimize a statistical tradeoff.Author summary A musician may learn to generalize behaviors across instruments for different purposes, for example, reusing hand motions used when playing classical on the flute to play jazz on the saxophone. Conversely, she may learn to play a single song across many instruments that require completely distinct physical motions, but nonetheless transfer knowledge between them. This degree of compositionality is often absent from computational frameworks of learning, forcing agents either to generalize entire learned policies or to learn new policies from scratch. Here, we propose a solution to this problem that allows an agent to generalize components of a policy independently and compare it to an agent that generalizes components as a whole. We show that the degree to which one form of generalization is favored over the other is dependent on the features of task domain, with independent generalization of task components favored in environments with weak relationships between components or high degrees of noise and joint generalization of task components favored when there is a clear, discoverable relationship between task components. Furthermore, we show that the overall meta structure of the environment can be learned and leveraged by an agent that dynamically arbitrates between these forms of structure learning.},

	abstract = {{\textquotedblleft}Superagers{\textquotedblright} are older adults who, despite their advanced age, maintain youthful memory. Previous morphometry studies revealed multiple default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions whose cortical thickness is preserved in superagers and correlates with memory performance. In this study, we examined the intrinsic functional connectivity within DMN and SN in 41 young (24.5 {\textpm} 3.6 years old) and 40 elderly adults (66.9 {\textpm} 5.5 years old). As in prior studies, superaging was defined as youthful performance on a memory recall task, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Participants underwent a resting state fMRI scan and performed a separate visual-verbal recognition memory task. As predicted, within both DMN and SN, superagers had stronger connectivity compared to typical older adults and similar connectivity compared to young adults. Superagers also performed similarly to young adults and better than typical older adults on the recognition task, demonstrating youthful episodic memory that generalized across memory tasks. Stronger connectivity within each network independently predicted better performance on both the CVLT and recognition task in older adults. Variation in intrinsic connectivity explained unique variance in memory performance, above and beyond preserved neuroanatomy. A post-hoc analysis revealed that DMN and SN nodes were more strongly inversely correlated in superagers than in typical older adults but were similarly correlated in superagers and young adults. Stronger between-network inverse correlations also predicted better memory performance in the entire sample of older adults. These results extend our understanding of the neural basis of superaging as a model of successful aging.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Memory capacity generally declines with age, but a unique group of older adults {\textendash} {\textquoteleft}superagers{\textquoteright} {\textendash} have memory capacities rivaling those of younger adults, as well as preserved neuroanatomy in an ensemble of regions contained in two core intrinsic brain networks {\textendash} the default mode and salience networks. In this study, we assessed the strength of intrinsic connectivity within these networks in superagers and typical older adults compared to young adults. We also expanded the behavioral assessment of memory. As predicted, superagers have intrinsic connectivity within the default mode and salience networks that is stronger than typical older adults and similar to that of young adults. Within older adults, preserved intrinsic connectivity within each network was uniquely associated with better memory performance.},

	abstract = {The default mode network (DMN) is believed to subserve the baseline mental activity in humans. Its highest energy consumption compared to other brain networks and its intimate coupling with conscious awareness are both pointing to an overarching function. Many research streams speak in favor of an evolutionarily adaptive role in envisioning experience to anticipate the future. In the present work, we propose a process model that tries to explain how the DMN may implement continuous evaluation and prediction of the environment to guide behavior. Specifically, we answer the question whether the neurobiological properties of the DMN collectively provide the computational building blocks necessary for a Markov Decision Process. We argue that our formal account of DMN function naturally accommodates as special cases previous interpretations based on (1) predictive coding, (2) semantic associations, and (3) a sentinel role. Moreover, this process model for the neural optimization of complex behavior in the DMN offers parsimonious explanations for recent experimental findings in animals and humans.},

Yet, some tissues may lack molecular profiles necessary for interactome inference (orphan tissues), or, as for single cells isolated from heterogeneous samples, their tissue context may be undetermined. To address this problem, we introduce metaVIPER, a novel algorithm designed to assess protein activity in tissue-independent by integrative analysis of multiple, non-tissue-matched interactomes. This assumes that transcriptional targets of each protein will be recapitulated by one or more available interactome. We confirmed the algorithm{\textquoteright}s value in assessing protein dysregulation induced by somatic mutations, as well as in assessing protein activity in orphan tissues and, most critically, in single cells, thus allowing transformation of noisy and potentially biased RNA-Seq signatures into reproducible protein-activity signatures.},

Here we review three theories of homeostatic control and ask how they provide insight into the circuitry underlying energy homeostasis. We offer two contributions. First, we detail how control theory and reinforcement learning are applied to homeostatic control. We show how these schemes rest on implausible assumptions; either via circular definitions, unprincipled drive functions, or by ignoring environmental volatility. We argue active inference can elude these shortcomings while retaining important features of each model. Second, we review the neural basis of energetic control. We focus on a subset of arcuate subpopulations that project directly to, and are thus in a privileged position to opponently modulate, dopaminergic cells as a function of energetic predictions over a spectrum of time horizons. We discuss how this can be interpreted under these theories, and how this can resolve paradoxes that have arisen. We propose this circuit constitutes a homeostatic-reward interface that underwrites the conjoint optimisation of physiological and behavioural homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Phasic dopamine release from mid-brain dopaminergic neurons signals errors of reward prediction (RPE). If reward maximisation is to maintain homeostasis, then the value of primary rewards should be coupled to the homeostatic errors they remediate. This leads to the prediction that RPE signals should be configured as a function of homeostatic state and thus, diminish with the attenuation of homeostatic error. To test this hypothesis, we collected a large volume of functional MRI data from five human volunteers on four separate days. After fasting for 12 hours, subjects consumed preloads that differed in glucose concentration. Participants then underwent a Pavlovian cue-conditioning paradigm in which the colour of a fixation-cross was stochastically associated with the delivery of water or glucose via a gustometer. This design afforded computation of RPE separately for better- and worse-than expected outcomes during ascending and descending trajectories of physiological serum glucose fluctuations. In the parabrachial nuclei, variations in regional activity coding positive RPEs scaled positively with serum glucose for ascending and descending glucose levels. The ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra became more sensitive to negative RPEs when glucose levels were ascending. Together, the results show that RPE signals in key brainstem structures are modulated by homeostatic trajectories of naturally occurring glycemic flux, revealing a tight interplay between homeostatic state and the neural encoding of primary reward in the human brain.},

Genetic variations underlying the architecture of cognitive phenotypes are likely to affect EF and associated behaviors. Mice lacking one of Ntng gene paralogs, encoding the vertebrate brain-specific presynaptic Netrin-G proteins, exhibit prominent deficits in the EF control. Brain areas responsible for gating the bottom-up and top-down information flows differentially express Ntng1 and Ntng2, distinguishing neuronal circuits involved in perception and cognition. As a result, high and low cognitive demand tasks (HCD and LCD, respectively) modulate Ntng1 and Ntng2 associations either with attention and impulsivity (AI) or working memory (WM), in a complementary manner. During the LCD Ntng2supported neuronal gating of AI and WM dominates over the Ntng1-associated circuits. This is reversed during the HCD, when the EF requires a larger contribution of cognitive control, supported by Ntng1, over the Ntng2 pathways. Since human NTNG orthologs have been reported to affect human IQ (1), and an array of neurological disorders (2), we believe that mouse Ntng gene paralogs serve an analogous role but influencing brain executive functioning.},

	abstract = {Prediction plays a crucial role in perception, as prominently suggested by predictive coding theories. However, the exact form and mechanism of predictive modulations of sensory processing remain unclear, with some studies reporting a downregulation of the sensory response for predictable input, while others observed an enhanced response. In a similar vein, downregulation of the sensory response for predictable input has been linked to either sharpening or dampening of the sensory representation, which are opposite in nature. In the present study we set out to investigate the neural consequences of perceptual expectation of object stimuli throughout the visual hierarchy, using fMRI in human volunteers. Participants (n=24) were exposed to pairs of sequentially presented object images in a statistical learning paradigm, in which the first object predicted the identity of the second object. Image transitions were not task relevant; thus all learning of statistical regularities was incidental. We found strong suppression of neural responses to expected compared to unexpected stimuli throughout the ventral visual stream, including primary visual cortex (V1), lateral occipital complex (LOC), and anterior ventral visual areas. Expectation suppression in LOC, but not V1, scaled positively with image preference, lending support to the dampening account of expectation suppression in object perception.Significance Statement Statistical regularities permeate our world and help us to perceive and understand our surroundings. It has been suggested that the brain fundamentally relies on predictions and constructs models of the world in order to make sense of sensory information. Previous research on the neural basis of prediction has documented expectation suppression, i.e. suppressed responses to expected compared to unexpected stimuli. In the present study we queried the presence and characteristics of expectation suppression throughout the ventral visual stream. We demonstrate robust expectation suppression in the entire ventral visual pathway, and underlying this suppression a dampening of the sensory representation in object-selective visual cortex, but not in primary visual cortex. Taken together, our results provide novel evidence in support of theories conceptualizing perception as an active inference process, which selectively dampens cortical representations of predictable objects. This dampening may support our ability to automatically filter out irrelevant, predictable objects.},

This process can occur at various spatial scales: from the microscopic (giving rise to cells) to the macroscopic (the emergence of organisms). Self-organisation at each level is essential to account for the hierarchical organisation of living organisms (organelles within cells, within tissues, within organs, etc.). In this paper, we pursue the idea that Markov blankets {\textendash} statistical boundaries separating states that are external to a system from its internal states {\textendash} emerge at every possible level of the description of the (living) system. Through simulations, we show that the concept of a Markov blanket is fundamental in defining biological systems and underwrites the nature and form of interactions between successive levels of hierarchical structure. We demonstrate the validity of our argument using simulations, based on the normative principle of variational free energy minimisation. Specifically, we adopt a top-down approach to provide a proof of concept for the claim that the self-organisation of Markov blankets (and blankets of blankets) underwrites the self-evidencing, autopoietic behaviour of living systems.},

Distinct anatomical and spectral channels may therefore play specialized roles in communication within hierarchical cortical networks; however, empirical evidence for this organization in humans is limited. We leverage high precision MEG to test this proposal, directly and non-invasively, in human participants during visually guided actions. Visual alpha activity mapped onto deep cortical laminae, whereas visual gamma activity predominantly arose from superficial laminae. This laminar-specificity was echoed in sensorimotor beta and gamma activity. Visual gamma activity scaled with task demands in a way compatible with feedforward signaling. For sensorimotor activity, we observed a more complex relationship with feedback and feedforward processes. Distinct frequency channels thus operate in a laminar-specific manner, but with dissociable functional roles across sensory and motor cortices.},

	abstract = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a direct measure of neuronal current flow; its anatomical resolution is therefore not constrained by physiology but rather by data quality and the models used to explain these data. Recent simulation work has shown that it is possible to distinguish between signals arising in the deep and superficial cortical laminae given accurate knowledge of these surfaces with respect to the MEG sensors. This previous work has focused around a single inversion scheme (multiple sparse priors) and a single global parametric fit metric (free energy). In this paper we use several different source inversion algorithms and both local and global, as well as parametric and non-parametric fit metrics in order to demonstrate the robustness of the discrimination between layers. We find that only algorithms with some sparsity constraint can successfully be used to make laminar discrimination. Importantly, local t-statistics, global cross-validation and free energy all provide robust and mutually corroborating metrics of fit. We show that discrimination accuracy is affected by patch size estimates, cortical surface features, and lead field strength, which suggests several possible future improvements to this technique. This study demonstrates the possibility of determining the laminar origin of MEG sensor activity, and thus directly testing theories of human cognition that involve laminar- and frequency- specific mechanisms. This possibility can now be achieved using recent developments in high precision MEG, most notably the use of subject-specific head-casts, which allow for significant increases in data quality and therefore anatomically precise MEG recordings.},

	abstract = {Abnormal initiation and control of voluntary movements are among the principal manifestations of Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD). However, the processes underlying these abnormalities and their potential remediation by dopamine treatment remain poorly understood. Normally, movements depend on the integration of sensory information with the predicted consequences of action. This integration leads to a suppression in the intensity of predicted sensations, and increases the relative salience of unexpected stimuli to facilitate the control of movements. We examined this integration process and its relation to dopamine in PD, by measuring sensorimotor attenuation {\textendash} the reduction in the perceived intensity of predicted sensations from self-generated versus external actions. Patients with idiopathic PD (n=18) and population-derived controls (n=175) matched a set of target forces applied to their left index finger by a torque motor. To match the force, participants either pressed with their right index finger ({\textquoteleft}Direct{\textquoteright} condition) or used a linear potentiometer that controlled a motor ({\textquoteleft}Slider{\textquoteright} condition). We found that despite changes in sensitivity to different forces, overall sensory attenuation did not differ between medicated PD patients and controls. Importantly, the degree of attenuation was negatively related to PD motor severity but positively related to individual patient dopamine dose, as measured by levodopa dose equivalency. The results suggest that dopamine could regulate the integration of sensorimotor prediction with sensory information to facilitate the control of voluntary movements.},

We outline a research program for investigating human emotion with these new tools, and provide initial findings from two large resting-state datasets as well as case studies in neurosurgical patients with electrical stimulation of the amygdala. The overarching goal is to use causal discovery methods on fMRI data to infer causal graphical models of how brain regions interact, and then to further constrain these models with direct stimulation of specific brain regions and concurrent fMRI. We conclude by discussing limitations and future extensions. The approach could yield anatomical hypotheses about brain connectivity, motivate rational strategies for treating mood disorders with deep brain stimulation, and could be extended to animal studies that use combined optogenetic fMRI.},

First, participants rated 525 images on the dimensions of valence and arousal and by intensity of discrete emotion categories (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and sadness). Thirteen new participants then viewed subsets of these images within an MEG scanner. We used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare behavioral ratings to the unfolding neural representation of the stimuli in the brain. Ratings of valence and arousal explained significant proportions of the MEG data, even after corrections for low-level image properties. Additionally, behavioral ratings of the discrete emotions fear, disgust, and happiness significantly predicted early neural representations, whereas rating models of anger and sadness did not. Different emotion constructs also showed unique temporal signatures. Fear and disgust {\textendash} both highly arousing and negative {\textendash} were rapidly discriminated by the brain, but disgust was represented for an extended period of time relative to fear. Overall, our findings suggest that 1) dimensions of valence and arousal are quickly represented by the brain, as are some discrete emotions, and 2) different emotion constructs exhibit unique temporal dynamics. We discuss implications of these findings for theoretical understanding of emotion and for the interplay of discrete and dimensional aspects of emotional experience.},

	abstract = {Humans display anticipatory motor responses to minimize the adverse effects of predictable perturbations. A widely accepted explanation for this behavior relies on the notion of an inverse model that, learning from motor errors, anticipates corrective responses. Here, we propose and validate the alternative hypothesis that anticipatory control can be realized through a cascade of purely sensory predictions that drive the motor system, reflecting the causal sequence of the perceptual events preceding the error. We compare both hypotheses in a simulated anticipatory postural adjustment task. We observe that adaptation in the sensory domain, but not in the motor one, supports the robust and generalizable anticipatory control characteristic of biological systems. Our proposal unites the neurobiology of the cerebellum with the theory of active inference and provides a concrete implementation of its core tenets with great relevance both to our understanding of biological control systems and, possibly, to their emulation in complex artefacts.},

	abstract = {Massive whole-brain blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal modulation (up to 95\% of brain voxels) in response to task stimuli has recently been reported in functional MRI investigations. These findings have two implications. First, they highlight inability of a conventional {\textquoteleft}top-down{\textquoteright} general linear model approach to capture all forms of task-driven brain activity. Second, as opposed to a static {\textquoteleft}active{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}non-active{\textquoteright} localization theory of the neural implementation of cognitive processes, functional neuroimaging should develop and pursue dynamical theories of cognition involving the dynamic interactions of all brain networks, in line with psychological constructionist theories of cognition. In this study, we describe a novel exploratory, bottom-up approach that directly estimates task-driven brain activity regardless of whether it follows an a priori reference function. Leveraging the property that task-driven brain activity is associated with reductions in BOLD signal variability, we combine the tools of instantaneous phase synchronization and independent component analysis to characterize whole-brain task-driven activity in terms of group-wise similarity in temporal signal dynamics of brain networks. We applied this novel framework to task fMRI data from a motor, theory of mind and working memory task provided through the Human Connectome Project. We discovered a large number of brain networks that dynamically synchronized to various features of the task scan, some overlapping with areas identified as {\textquoteleft}active{\textquoteright} in the top-down GLM approach. Using the results provided through this novel approach, we provide a more comprehensive description of cognitive processes whereby task-related brain activity is not restricted to dichotomous {\textquoteleft}active{\textquoteright} or {\textquoteleft}non-active{\textquoteright} inferences, but is characterized by the temporal dynamics of brain networks across time.Significance Statement This study describes the results of a novel exploratory methodological approach that allows for direct estimation of task-driven brain activity in terms of group-wise similarity in temporal signal dynamics, as opposed to the conventional approach of identifying task-driven brain activity with a hypothesized temporal pattern. This approach applied to three different task paradigms yielded novel insights into the brain activity associated with these tasks in terms of time-varying, low-frequency dynamics of replicable synchronization networks. We suggest that this exploratory methodological approach provides a framework in which the complexity and dynamics of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes can be captured more comprehensively.},

Conventional rodent VR systems provide 3D visual cues linked to restrained locomotion on a treadmill, leading to a mismatch between visual and most other sensory inputs, sensory-motor conflicts, as well as restricted naturalistic behavior. To rectify these limitations, we developed a VR system (ratCAVE) that provides realistic and low-latency visual feedback directly to head movements of completely unrestrained rodents. Immersed in this VR system, rats displayed naturalistic behavior by spontaneously interacting with and hugging virtual walls, exploring virtual objects, and avoiding virtual cliffs. We further illustrate the effect of ratCAVE-VR manipulation on hippocampal place fields. The newly-developed methodology enables a wide range of experiments involving flexible manipulation of visual feedback in freely-moving behaving animals.},

This formulation is problematic for two reasons: First, cognitive maps are traditionally conceptualized to generalize over individual episodes, which conflicts with evidence associating the hippocampus with episodic memory, and second, it fails to explain seemingly non-hippocampal forms of planning. Here we propose a novel theoretical framework that resolves these issues: each long-term memory system is a cognitive map, predicting consequences of actions based on its unique computational properties. It follows that hippocampal maps are episode-based and that semantic, procedural, and Pavlovian memories each implement a specialized map. We present evidence for each type of map from neuropsychology, neuroimaging and animal electrophysiology studies.},

However, dopamine neurons exhibit several notable deviations from this hypothesis. A coherent explanation for these deviations can be obtained by analyzing the dopamine response in terms of Bayesian reinforcement learning. The key idea is that prediction errors are modulated by probabilistic beliefs about the relationship between cues and outcomes, updated through Bayesian inference. This account can explain dopamine responses to inferred value in sensory preconditioning, the effects of cue pre-exposure (latent inhibition) and adaptive coding of prediction errors when rewards vary across orders of magnitude. We further postulate that orbitofrontal cortex transforms the stimulus representation through recurrent dynamics, such that a simple error-driven learning rule operating on the transformed representation can implement the Bayesian reinforcement learning update.},

If we rotate the object, we achieve a pool of observed shadows from different angulations, gradients, shapes and variable length contours that make it possible for us to increase our available information. Starting from this simple observation, we show how informational entropies might turn out to be useful in the evaluation of scale-free dynamics in the brain. Indeed, brain activity exhibits a scale-free distribution, which appears as a straight line when plotted in a log power versus log frequency plot. A variation in the scale-free exponent and in the line scaling slope may occur during different functional neurophysiological states. Here we show that modifications in scaling slope are associated with variations in R{\'e}nyi entropy, a generalization of Shannon informational entropy. From a three-dimensional object{\textquoteright}s perspective, by changing its orientation (standing for the cortical scale-free exponent), we detect different two-dimensional shadows from different perception angles (standing for R{\`e}nyi entropy in different brain areas). We perform simulations showing how, starting from known values of R{\`e}nyi entropy (easily detectable in brain fMRIs or EEG traces), it is feasible to calculate the scaling slope in a given moment and a given brain area. Because changes in scale-free cortical dynamics modify brain activity, suggests the possibility of novel insights in mind reading and description of the forces required for transcranial stimulation.},

To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive control {\textendash} a set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different sets of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory suggests that cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas may mediate processes of network reorganization that support transitions between dynamical states. In this study, we used a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological states of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquired fMRI BOLD signal in twenty{\textendash}eight healthy subjects as they performed two cognitive control tasks {\textendash} a local-global perception switching task using Navon figures and a Stroop interference task {\textendash} each with low cognitive control demand and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we constructed dynamic functional brain networks and used a parts-based network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captured key dynamical states involved in control processes. Our results demonstrate that the temporal expression of these functional subgraphs reflect cognitive demands and are associated with individual differences in task-based performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of distributed brain networks map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.},

	abstract = {Understanding how the brain learns to compute functions reliably, efficiently and robustly with noisy spiking activity is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent networks, e.g. the contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally. Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and robust computation at the population level.},

Here we propose a new model {\textendash} the Reinforcement Meta Learner (RML) {\textendash} based on the bidirectional anatomical connections of the ACC with midbrain catecholamine nuclei (VTA and LC). In this circuit, dACC learns which actions are valuable and acts accordingly. Crucially, this mechanism is optimized by recurrent connectivity with the midbrain: Midbrain catecholamines provide modulatory signals to dACC, controlling its internal parameters (e.g. learning rate), while these parameter modulations are in turn optimized by dACC afferents to the midbrain. This closed-loop system generates emergent (i.e., homunculus-free) control and supports learning to solve hierarchical decision problems without having an intrinsic hierarchical structure itself. Further, it can be combined with other cortical modules to optimize the processing of these modules. We outline how the RML solves the current theoretical stalemate on dACC by assimilating various previous proposals on ACC functioning, and how it captures critical empirical findings from an unprecedented range of domains (stability/plasticity balance, effort processing, working memory, and higher-order classical and instrumental conditioning).},

Across different environments of similar geometry, these representations show strong orthogonality in CA3 of hippocampus, whereas in the CA1 subfield a considerable overlap between the maps can be seen. The lower orthogonality decreases reliability of various decoders developed in an attempt to identify which of the stored maps is active at the mo-ment. Especially, the problem with decoding emerges with a need to analyze data at high temporal resolution. Here, we introduce a functional-connectivity-based de-coder, which accounts for the pairwise correlations between the spiking activities of neurons in each map and does not require any positional information, i.e. any knowledge about place fields. We first show, on recordings of hippocampal activity in constant environmental conditions, that our decoder outperforms existing decoding methods in CA1. Our decoder is then applied to data from teleportation experiments, in which an instantaneous switch between the environment identity triggers a recall of the corresponding spatial representation. We test the sensitivity of our approach on the transition dynamics between the respective memory states (maps). We find that the rate of spontaneous state shifts (flickering) after a teleportation event is increased not only within the first few seconds as already reported, but this instability is sustained across much longer (\&gt; 1 min.) periods.},

But how these rhythmic activities are linked to cell-type specific activity has remained unclear. Here, we suggest such a cell-to-systems level linkage. We found that the rate of burst spiking events is enhanced particularly during attention states and that attention-specific burst spikes have a unique temporal relationship to local theta and beta band population level activities. For the 5-10Hz theta frequency range, bursts coincided with transient increases of local theta power relative to non-bursts, particularly for bursts of putative interneurons. For the 16-30Hz beta frequency, bursts of putative interneurons phase synchronized stronger than nonbursts, and were associated with larger beta power modulation. In contrast, burst of putative pyramidal cells were overall similarly beta-synchronized than nonbursts, but were linked with stronger beta power only when they occurred early in the beta cycle. These findings suggests that in the ACC/PFC during attention states, mechanisms underlying burst firing are intimately linked to narrow band population level activities, providing a cell-type specific window into the emergence, resetting, or termination of oscillatory activities.},

We do so by distinguishing between two broad classes of priors on which the brain{\textquoteright}s inferential systems operate: in one category are biological priors (β priors) and in the other artifactual ones (α priors). We argue that β priors, of which colour categories and faces are good examples, are inherited or acquired very rapidly after birth, are highly or relatively resistant to change through experience, and are common to all humans. The consequence is that the probability of posteriors generated from β priors having universal assent and agreement is high. By contrast, α priors, of which man-made objects are examples, are acquired post-natally and modified at various stages throughout post-natal life; they are much more accommodating of, and hospitable to, new experiences. Consequently, posteriors generated from them are less likely to find universal assent. Taken together, in addition to the more limited capacity of experiment and experience to alter the β priors compared to α priors, another cardinal distinction between the two is that the probability of posteriors generated from β priors having universal agreement is greater than that for α priors. The two categories are not, however, always totally distinct and can merge into one another to varying extents, resulting in posteriors that draw upon both categories.},

To address this question, we analysed the performance of two cohorts of participants on reinforcement learning tasks using a computational model that was adapted to test if prediction error valance influences learning. Concerning factual learning, we replicated previous findings of a valence-induced bias, whereby participants learned preferentially from positive, relative to negative, prediction errors. In contrast, for counterfactual learning, we found the opposite valence-induced bias: negative prediction errors were preferentially taken into account relative to positive ones. When considering valence-induced bias in the context of both factual and counterfactual learning, it appears that people tend to preferentially take into account information that confirms their current choice},

	abstract = {Progress in modern neuroscience critically depends on our ability to observe the activity of large neuronal populations with cellular spatial and high temporal resolution. However, two bottlenecks constrain efforts towards fast imaging of large populations. First, the resulting large video data is challenging to analyze. Second, there is an explicit tradeoff between imaging speed, signal-to-noise, and field of view: with current recording technology we cannot image very large neuronal populations with simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution.Here we describe multi-scale approaches for alleviating both of these bottlenecks. First, we show that spatial and temporal decimation techniques provide order-of-magnitude speedups in spatiotemporally demixing calcium video data into estimates of single-cell neural activity. Second, once the shapes of individual neurons have been identified (e.g., after an initial phase of conventional imaging with standard temporal and spatial resolution), we find that the spatial/temporal resolution tradeoff shifts dramatically: after demixing we can accurately recover neural activity from data that has been spatially decimated by an order of magnitude. This offers a cheap method for compressing this large video data, and also implies that it is possible to either speed up imaging significantly, or to {\textquotedblleft}zoom out{\textquotedblright} by a corresponding factor to image order-of-magnitude larger neuronal populations with minimal loss in accuracy or temporal resolution.Author Summary The voxel rate of imaging systems ultimately sets the limit on the speed of data acquisition. These limits often mean that only a small fraction of the activity of large neuronal populations can be observed at high spatio-temporal resolution. For imaging of very large populations with single cell resolution, temporal resolution is typically sacrificed. Here we propose a multi-scale approach to achieve single cell precision using fast imaging at reduced spatial resolution. In the first phase the spatial location and shape of each neuron is obtained at standard spatial resolution; in the second phase imaging is performed at much lower spatial resolution. We show that we can apply a demixing algorithm to accurately recover each neuron{\textquoteright}s activity from the low-resolution data by exploiting the high-resolution cellular maps estimated in the first imaging phase. Thus by decreasing the spatial resolution in the second phase, we can compress the video data significantly, and potentially acquire images over an order-of-magnitude larger area, or image at significantly higher temporal resolution, with minimal loss in accuracy of the recovered neuronal activity. We evaluate this approach on real data from light-sheet and 2-photon calcium imaging.},

However, interpreting these measurements is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is greatly complicated by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which can exhibit complex and nonlinear waveforms, and overlap temporarily with evoked spikes. Here we develop a scalable algorithm based on a structured Gaussian Process model to estimate the artifact and identify evoked spikes. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated in both real and simulated 512-electrode recordings in the peripheral primate retina with single-electrode and several types of multi-electrode stimulation. We establish small error rates in the identification of evoked spikes, with a computational complexity that is compatible with real-time data analysis. This technology may be helpful in the design of future high-resolution sensory prostheses based on tailored stimulation (e.g., retinal prostheses), and for closed-loop neural stimulation at a much larger scale than currently possible.Author Summary Simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these recordings is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is largely stymied by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which are typically larger than the signals of interest. We develop a novel computational framework to estimate and subtract away this contaminating artifact, enabling the large-scale analysis of responses of possibly hundreds of cells to tailored stimulation. Importantly, we suggest that this technology may also be helpful for the development of future high-resolution neural prosthetic devices (e.g., retinal prostheses).},

	abstract = {The brain constantly infers the causes of the inputs it receives and uses these inferences to generate statistical expectations about future observations. Experimental evidence for these expectations and their violations include explicit reports, sequential effects on reaction times, and mismatch or surprise signals recorded in electrophysiology and functional MRI. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the brain acts as a near-optimal inference device that constantly attempts to infer the time-varying matrix of transition probabilities between the stimuli it receives, even when those stimuli are in fact fully unpredictable. This parsimonious Bayesian model, with a single free parameter, accounts for a broad range of findings on surprise signals, sequential effects and the perception of randomness. Notably, it explains the pervasive asymmetry between repetitions and alternations encountered in those studies. Our analysis suggests that a neural machinery for inferring transition probabilities lies at the core of human sequence knowledge.Author SummaryWe explore the possibility that the computation of time-varying transition probabilities may be a core building block of sequence knowledge in humans. Humans may then use these estimates to predict future observations. Expectations derived from such a model should conform to several properties. We list six such properties and we test them successfully against various experimental findings reported in distinct fields of the literature over the past century. We focus on five representative studies by other groups. Such findings include the {\textquotedblleft}sequential effects{\textquotedblright} evidenced in many behavioral tasks, i.e. the pervasive fluctuations in performance induced by the recent history of observations. We also consider the {\textquotedblleft}surprise-like{\textquotedblright} signals recorded in electrophysiology and even functional MRI, that are elicited by a random stream of observations. These signals are reportedly modulated in a quantitative manner by both the local and global statistics of observations. Last, we consider the notoriously biased subjective perception of randomness, i.e. whether humans think that a given sequence of observations has been generated randomly or not. Our model therefore unifies many previous findings and suggest that a neural machinery for inferring transition probabilities must lie at the core of human sequence knowledge.},

	abstract = {The coordinated regulation of protein kinases is a rapid mechanism that integrates diverse cues and swiftly determines appropriate cellular responses. However, our understanding of cellular decision-making has been limited by the small number of simultaneously monitored phospho-regulatory events. Here, we have estimated changes in activity in 215 human kinases in 399 conditions from a compilation of nearly 3 million phosphopeptide quantifications. This atlas identifies commonly regulated kinases as those that are central in the signaling network and defines the logic relationships between kinase pairs. Co-regulation along the conditions predicts kinase-complex and kinase-substrate associations. Additionally, the kinase regulation profile acts as a molecular fingerprint to identify related and opposing signaling states. Using this atlas, we identified essential mediators of stem cell differentiation, modulators of Salmonella infection and new targets of AKT1. This provides a global view of human phosphorylation-based signaling and the necessary context to better understand kinase driven decision-making.},

	abstract = {Habits form a crucial component of behavior. In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as arising from model-free reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, which typically select between available actions based on the future value expected to result from each. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as behaviors that can be triggered directly by a stimulus, without requiring the animal to evaluate expected outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits develop through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions rather than through the encoding of outcomes. We demonstrate that this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the effects of reinforcement schedule on the rate of habit formation. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated-choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data. This mapping may provide a new foundation for building robust and comprehensive models of the interaction of habits with other, more goal-directed types of behaviors and help to better guide research into the neural mechanisms underlying control of instrumental behavior more generally.},

	abstract = {Being able to predict self-generated sensory consequences is an important feature of normal brain functioning. In the auditory domain, self-generated sounds lead to smaller brain responses compared to externally generated sounds. Here we investigated the role of brain oscillations underlying this effect. With magnetoencephalography, we show that self-generated sounds are associated with increased pre-stimulus alpha power and decreased post-stimulus gamma power and alpha/beta phase locking in auditory cortex. All these oscillatory changes are correlated with changes in evoked responses. Furthermore, they correlate with each other across participants, supporting the idea that they constitute a neural information processing sequence for self-generated sounds, with pre-stimulus alpha power representing prediction and post-stimulus gamma power representing prediction error, which is further processed with post-stimulus alpha/beta phase resetting. Additional cross-trial analysis provides further support for the proposed sequence that might reflect a general mechanism for the prediction of self-generated sensory input.},

	abstract = {Cells react to extracellular perturbations with complex and intertwined responses. Systematic identification of the regulatory mechanisms that control these responses is still a challenge and requires tailored analyses integrating different types of molecular data. Here we acquired time-resolved metabolomics measurements in yeast under salt and pheromone stimulation and developed a machine learning approach to explore regulatory associations between metabolism and signal transduction. Existing phosphoproteomics measurements under the same conditions and kinase-substrate regulatory interactions were used to estimate the enzymatic activity of signalling kinases. Our approach identified informative associations between kinases and metabolic enzymes capable of predicting metabolic changes. We extended our analysis to two studies containing transcriptomics, phosphoproteomics and metabolomics measurements across a comprehensive panel of kinases/phosphatases knockouts and time-resolved perturbations to the nitrogen metabolism, conveying a total of 143 unique conditions. Our approach accurately estimated the change in activity of transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases and these were capable of building predictive models to infer the metabolic adaptations of previously unseen conditions across different dynamic experiments. Time-resolved experiments were significantly more informative than genetic perturbations to infer metabolic adaptation. This difference may be due to the indirect nature of the associations and of general cellular states that can hinder the identification of causal relationships. This work provides a novel genome-scale integrative analysis to propose putative transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms of metabolic processes.},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in developing novel brain stimulation methods to control disease-related aberrant neural activity and to address basic neuroscience questions. Conventional methods for manipulating brain activity rely on open-loop approaches that usually lead to excessive stimulation and, crucially, do not restore the original computations performed by the network. Thus, they are often accompanied by undesired side-effects. Here, we introduce delayed feedback control (DFC), a conceptually simple but effective method, to control pathological oscillations in spiking neural networks. Using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations we show that DFC can restore a wide range of aberrant network dynamics either by suppressing or enhancing synchronous irregular activity. Importantly, DFC besides steering the system back to a healthy state, it also recovers the computations performed by the underlying network. Finally, using our theory we isolate the role of single neuron and synapse properties in determining the stability of the closed-loop system.},
