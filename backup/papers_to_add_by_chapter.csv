Combining active inference and hierarchical predictive coding: a tutorial introduction and case study,11,Simulation
Contrastive active inference,11,"One particular challenge with such discrete state-space active inference models is the fact that it is difficult to scale the model to a large number of states and quickly becomes computationally expensive. In Chapter 13 we described \textit{contrastive active inference} \citep{Mazzaglia2021-oj} a possible approach to more effecient discrete-state space active inference-based control using contrastive learning. The authors in this paper argue that since complete pixel-level visual reconstruction is expensive and may be unnecessary for many tasks, the model's complexity can be reduced if it selectively choose which observations are relevant for the decision-making task at hand. After augmenting VFE and EFE with a contrastive loss term, the model better identifies similar observations that were likely generate by the hidden state to be inferred. "

"Uncertainty, epistemics and active inference",11,Excellent discrete time notation. Add to Chapter 11 - precision updating for discrete time active inference.
Variational Inference for Predictive and Reactive Controllers,11,"The authors interpret the work in \citep{Oliver2019-uo, Pezzato2019-mx} in terms of \textit{reactive control}. They point out the fact that because continuous state-space active inference can only adaptively react to prediction errors it will have a much slower response. By separating the state-estimation and action steps the model can run them in parallel and adapt faster to environmental changes. Reactive control. Re-read this paper in more detail. It's kind of a robotics paper but really they introduce a few modifications to generalized filtering."

Perceptions as hypotheses: saccades as experiments,15,"Great notation and important perspective on action and Bayesian surprise to add to Chapter 7. Will be useful to refer back to this paper for Chapter 8 because it shows how to construct the block matrices for hierarchical models. For Chapter 15, there is good info here for the equivalence section. Consideration of infomax for example and other equivalences are laid out here. Also, the extension here about salience and hidden state controls needs to be mentioned in Chapter 11."
