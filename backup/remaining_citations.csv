Combining active inference and hierarchical predictive coding: a tutorial introduction and case study,[11],Simulation,Paperpile
Contrastive active inference,[11],"One particular challenge with such discrete state-space active inference models is the fact that it is difficult to scale the model to a large number of states and quickly becomes computationally expensive. In Chapter 13 we described \textit{contrastive active inference} \citep{Mazzaglia2021-oj} a possible approach to more effecient discrete-state space active inference-based control using contrastive learning. The authors in this paper argue that since complete pixel-level visual reconstruction is expensive and may be unnecessary for many tasks, the model's complexity can be reduced if it selectively choose which observations are relevant for the decision-making task at hand. After augmenting VFE and EFE with a contrastive loss term, the model better identifies similar observations that were likely generate by the hidden state to be inferred. ",Paperpile

"Uncertainty, epistemics and active inference",[11],Excellent discrete time notation. Add to Chapter 11 - precision updating for discrete time active inference.,Paperpile
Variational Inference for Predictive and Reactive Controllers,[11],"The authors interpret the work in \citep{Oliver2019-uo, Pezzato2019-mx} in terms of \textit{reactive control}. They point out the fact that because continuous state-space active inference can only adaptively react to prediction errors it will have a much slower response. By separating the state-estimation and action steps the model can run them in parallel and adapt faster to environmental changes. Reactive control. Re-read this paper in more detail. It's kind of a robotics paper but really they introduce a few modifications to generalized filtering.",Paperpile
